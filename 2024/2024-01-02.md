### Jérémie

- I was off last week.
- Added support for Flexiblas in threadpoolctl.
- Will start preparing the 1.4 final release.

### Loïc

- Add meson support https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28040
- simplify global_random_seed plugin waiting for reviews: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27963
- pytest issue has been moving along during the holidays https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9765  although Franck's PR not merged (probably needs a test from the reproducer)

### Jérôme 

- was on vacation
- started working on dataframe summaries for skrub

### Gael

- I'm working on a position paper evaluating the merit of scale for IA. It's very interesting: shows the importance of smaller models, and, most importantly, that big models are very costly and not sustainable unless there is a strong revenue-generating stream associated
