### Gael

- Cannot be present at the meeting today
- Not much for scikit-learn/probabl lately. Most related topic: doing a study on the costs, effectiveness and trends of large models in IA. Happy to discuss this study with people

### Olivier

- Reviewed `r2_score` and `Ridge` Array API PRs
- Catching up with work on survival/competing risks analysis by Julie and Vincent
- Reviewing some PRs by Christian on improving and fixing hgbdt:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28074 (pyodide deser)
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28063 (stochastic gradient boosting)
- Other Array API related to review:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28067
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27491

### Franck

- Iterating on `r2_score` and `Ridge` array api PRs [1](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27904/checks?check_run_id=20196215843), [2](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27800)
    - clear path to merge now, hoping second reviews go well
    - also note on support for non-float64 ready devices [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3Afcharras)
    - also a bit of cleaning/esthethic PRs [1](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28057) (to merge?) 
- With @lesteve got to debug [this pytest issue](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9765), found a reasonable explanation/fix
    - [fix](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/11708) and [non-regression test (best effort)](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/11725)

### Jérôme

- prototyping skrub visualization tools in [skrubview](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrubview)
- before break
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27911
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27734


### Guillaume

- In vacation
- Getting into the notification
- Meeting Anna
- MOOC forum
- Question: parameter validation and sparse container
- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27983

### Loïc

- Meson PR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28040. Try it and give feed-back, no need to understand all the meson.build for this ;-). Once this is merged: make `make in` use meson ?
- Pytest `assert mod not in mods` progress with Franck https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9765 and https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/11708
- simplify global_random_seed plugin to work-around (needs review): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27963 
- Maintenance:
  + Remove some pins and old cruft from CI lock-files https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28082
  + Add `--select-tag` to `update_environment_and_lock_files.py` to make life easier for lock-file workflow https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28068
  + Fix scipy-dev (merged) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28047. sparse 1d array now exists in scipy `main`, only coo, csr/csc coming at one point may be an issue for scikit-learn, not sure https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/18530
  + remove unused lock file (merged) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28061

### TODO

- address review of Joel on `TunedThresholdClassifier` (Guillaume)
- release 1.4 (Jeremie, Guillaume)
