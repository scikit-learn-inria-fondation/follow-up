### Gael

- For scikit-learn:
    - Doc PR on calibration https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28171 because some people on internet take offence
- Working on a paper on why the bigger-is-better narrative in IA is dangerous (happy to share it)
- A bit of vision for skrub and ensembl

### Loïc

- Meson
  + Meson PR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28040. Merge it, `make dev-meson` and carry on! Things can be improved as we go :wink:!
- Pytest: the 8.0.0rc crusade seems to be over
  + another issue with `__file__` casing on Windows has been fixed (not by me) https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11816 
  + 8.0.0rc2 works on h5py https://github.com/h5py/h5py/pull/2371
  + waiting for scipy input to be 100% sure: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/19847
- scikit-learn
  + CI scipy-dev clean-up: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28163
  + PyPy still not completing on conda-forge even with the loss fix that reduced memory usage ... also timing out when updating lock files, maybe scipy 1.12 related? :cry: How much work should we do to support PyPy?
  + scipy-dev and main update lock files started failing DeprecationWarning due to pandas 3.0 that will require arrow
  + Merged Windows fixes for update_environment_and_lock_files: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28133
- Jean-Zay partial stoppage February 5: 
  + https://github.com/jean-zay-users/jean-zay-doc/issues/97 
  + Created a pad for Adastra: https://notes.inria.fr/ZLaojVJ2StiRPdpsT4aBSQ#
  + Trying to do the access procedure, way too painful even for me, who knows (roughly) how it is supposed to work. Currently stuck Inria side ...
- Misc
  + better ccache integration in conda-forge: https://github.com/conda-forge/compilers-feedstock/issues/31
  + Reported a scipy 1.12rc change in `pip list output` (fixed) https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/19906
  + Update scikit-learn to 1.4.0 in Pyodide: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/4409

### Jérémie

- release 1.4.0(-1)
  TODO email sklearn internal for cirrus ci
- small KMeans fix (merged)
- opened an RFC to expose a public method to compute the objective function
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28169
- drafting meeting: consistent API for early stopping / validation set
  TODO write an RFC do discuss remaining details
- threadpoolctl
  - flexiblas PR is ready https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/156
  - unpin numpy < 2 in CI https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/160

### Guillaume

- Helping Jeremie for the release
- Working on releasing imbalanced-learn with some internal compatibility issue
- Investigate a regression in the sparse-sparse `kneigbors` case with large number of features
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28191
- Meeting MOOC & Early-Stopping
- Keep up with the issue/PR tracker

### Olivier

- A bit of release assist, MOOC meeting and drafting meeting on early stopping
- Investigated the state of support for `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` in Python wheel building and more generally reproducible builds to detect supply chain attacks:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/28151
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28152
    - Good news: there is dedicated person at PSF / PyPA working on this for CPython itself and then for the pypi.org artifacts:
    - https://sigmoid.social/@ogrisel/111777800354536187
- Tried to fix meson-python to have `pkg.walk_packages` work for scikit-learn common tests:
    - https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/pull/562
    - Still some work to do to have a custom implementation of `iter_modules`.
- Started to think about a design on about how to build an alternative to `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` with:
    - more natural dataframe support;
    - ability to construct both `X` and `y` from several sources (e.g. parquet files) while making it possible to cross-validate everything.
    - make it natural to interactively and incrementally build the "pipeline" while observing the intermediate transformed values on a subsample train / test split.
- Calibration example: tune C on neg log loss.

### Arturo

- a bit of mooc forum / meeting with Learning Lab
- some reviews
- iter on hgbt PR [#26991](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26991)
- Gael's [mediation project](https://notes.inria.fr/Uz9HaPyJQ1yDY_LUuT2f-A#)
- will be off next week

### Jérôme 

- skrubview:
  - added Cramer V to detect highly associated columnns. 
  - TODO: how to vizualize detections + column pairs
- skrub:
  - in tablevectorizer pr
    - approach for using dataframe api, pandas & polars "native" code
    - continue utilities for tv's preprocessing
