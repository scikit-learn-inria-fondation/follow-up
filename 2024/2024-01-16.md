### Olivier

- Did reviews for many PRs mentioned in last week's meeting.
- Investigated the cause of missing collected test in Loic's PR on the meson build system with the meson-python editable install
    - Found a workaround (fix?) for `pkgutil.walk_packages`, [see this comment](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/issues/557#issuecomment-1892560127).
    - Not sure what is the way forward.
- First pass of review on Christian's PR to numpy to contribute an equivalent of our `_weighted_percentile` upstream in numpy:
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8935
    - Still need to wrap my head on why weights would mean for the various ways to compute quantiles from a sample (by reading reference paper linked in the discussion).
- Read security blog post on a supply chain attack on GitHub Actions: 
    - https://johnstawinski.com/2024/01/11/playing-with-fire-how-we-executed-a-critical-supply-chain-attack-on-pytorch/
    - My conclusions:
        - this attack would not work today on scikit-learn's CI because we do not yet use self-hosted runners;
        - if we were to use self-hosted runners, we should be careful to approve workflows manually for external contributors on such runners and configure them to be ephemeral runners;
        - we should be careful to not grant unnecessary permissions to github tokens used in our GitHub Actions workflows in general and refrain from using PATs (Personal Access Tokens) if we can, or limit the permissions granted to accounts with PATs.

### Gael

- Money for probabl
- Talked to Vincent

### Loïc

- Meson
  + Meson PR progressing: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28040. Soon mergeable?
  + meson-python issue `__path__` is `[]` https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson-python/issues/557. Side-effect: this skips some common tests
  + separate test fixes for Meson from main PR (merged): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28094
- Pytest
  + `assert mod not in mods` fix PR merged \o/ https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/11708. Team work with Franck.
  + the crusade is not over, 8.0.x seems still quite broken on Windows ... https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11816
  + `assert mod not in mods` error message improvement: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/11795 
- scikit-learn
  + cross 32bit/64bit training/deployment (merged) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28074
  + "lightning quick review" PR to fix the lock-file update workflow https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/28140
- Jean-Zay partial stoppage February 5: https://github.com/jean-zay-users/jean-zay-doc/issues/97 
  + random side-comment when saying "Yes, I need software", scikit-learn has its own tick-box
