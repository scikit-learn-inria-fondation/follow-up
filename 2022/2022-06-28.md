### Gael
- Putting the hire of L.H. on track (estimated start date nov 1st)
- Technical specs for data wrangling tasks, with Oliver and François, skabular
- TODO: order the hoodies (I forgot)

### Olivier

- Currently working on improving the tests for the newton-cholesky solver on  collinear designs and suggest to fallback to LBFGS globally instead of iteration.
    - Context: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23314
- Decided to pause the GLM intercept work to merge the tight GLM tests PR as is:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23619
    - Need second review
- Reviewed sparse/dense metrics PR:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23585
    - Need second review
- Various scikit-learn reviews, in particular `set_output` PR/SLEP [#23734](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23734/)
- Design discussion with Arturo on text hyper-parameter tuning example + plotly dependency config [#23528](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23528)
- Documented a bit the ongoing work on the GPU plugin system (more work needed before Franck joins)
- Discussion on data-wrangling tooling (outside of the main scikit-learn project): relational data, tools to join and expand/enrich columns  with geographical, temporal or named entitities with external knowledge databases in various formats.

### François

- Met Inessa Pawson (Numpy): shared good practices of communication, discussed the user survey.
- Met Abdelhouaed and Gilles for the offices. We will soon move to Salle Nicole-Reine Lepaute when they have finished to empty it and put some new lights.
