### Franck

Off for two weeks.

### Gael

Last week/month:
- Euroscipy
- Hiring (project manager for data wrangling project)

TODO:
- Land
- Proposal for French gov (Gael, Francois)
- Iterate governance (Gael, Julien) 

### Julien

 - Finished preparting talk for EuroSciPy 2022
 - Started a script / benchmark for obtaining plots between 2 revisions
 - Review of Franck's implementation of k-means: merged.
 - Contributed a `pre-commit` setup to `dirty_cat`
 - Reviewed of some PRs for scikit-learn, including:
     - [Array API for LDA](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22554)
     - [Factorisation for sklearn-numba-dpex](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/14)
 - Next:
     - Review [FEA add interaction constraints to HGBT](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21020)
     - Iterate on a draft for Governance Document as [discussed yesterday](https://github.com/scikit-learn/administrative/commit/a8aafe4a4d227c5fc9b75bee5eb1aece608ba7d4)
 - Off on Thursday afternoon, but there for meeting with Intel 
 - Questions:
     - Would like to write article about Cython + some library internals for [Scientific Python's blog](https://blog.scientific-python.org/).
     - Interested to participate in two [Scientific Python's summits](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/summits/27) (likely remote work sessions organised by maintainers for maintainers regarding common technical issues/subjects)
         - [Sparse Array Summit](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/sparse-array-summit/365/5)
         - [Ragged Array Summit](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/ragged-array-summit/465/2)

### Loïc

- [JupyterLite PoC]((https://incomparable-youtiao-5239a9.netlify.app/lab?path=full-index.ipynb)) for MOOC notebooks: feel free to beta-test! [repo](https://github.com/lesteve/scikit-learn-mooc-jupyterlite). Bigger problems noticed:
  + tab completion broken with xeus-python kernel: https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-python-kernel/issues/77
  + kernel takes a long time to initialise 30-45s (probably because of size of packages?)
  + memory issues when opening 3-4 kernels, with not super helpful behaviour (only errors in the browser console)
- CI issues seen in updating lock files PR by Olivier https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24363
  + Weird inconsistency in scipy numpy pinning https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16964
  + PR to pin numpy https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24373
- thinking about maybe starting the brownout for the `sklearn` package at one point (beginning October?): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8215#issuecomment-864879723
