### Gael

* Budget SNIA with Fran√ßois
* Gone for a week and a half


### Olivier

- A bit of MOOC forum watching
- Some reviews:
    - Newton Cholesky for GLM regressors https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24637 (merged): next include in LogisticRegressor for the binary classification case
    - sklearn-numba-dpex k-means cluster relocation https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/26 (merged)
    - joblib review https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1354
- Procrastinated with float32 RNG
- Survival Benchmark tree-based transform + first analysis of benchmark results
    - Our tree based method (slightly) beat the best neural net from PyCox as reported in there paper
    - Tree-transform (apply should be of scikit-learn)
- Continue Ibis evaluation for Survival Analysis Benchmark on kkbox
    - https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark
    - DuckDB (in-process) and ClickHouseDB (requires server) support is great and high performance
    - Lack of support for the full window function API in many backends (dask, pandas, polars, arrow datafusion...)
    - Could probably try to leverage specialized subset (e.g. `.lag` on grouped expr) but still not 100% sure

### Franck

- GPU Kmeans: merged [cluster relocation PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/26) and [numerical stability PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/33)
- Tried (non successfully) to build the entirety of `numba_dpex` stack with cuda support
- Working on [GPU Kmeans++](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/37), more preparation required than expected:
    - state of random generation on devices with numba_dpex [issue](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/758)
    - investigation about numerical stability in pairwise distance compute
- More thorough review of the gap between numba.cuda / numba_dpex:
    - gap is "wide" but not "deep"
- Discussion with Tim Head about the [plugin interface](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24497/#discussion_r1000539312) 
- Interactions with `numba_dpex` devs on portability
- Pulled master on `joblib` [PR](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/588) for `return_generator`
    - tests pass with dask backend but pipeline fail with a crash of dask backend when interpreter exits
    - issues with pypy
    - RQ: utiliser faulthandler.

### Fran√ßois

- Planning Strat√©gie nationale IA and a few last details with Ga√´l and Jean-Michel. We shared a first version with Inria board. 
- Meeting about our move to Nicole Reine Lepaute, we will probably move in January (Fran√ßois)
- US brand renewal - sent a first version of the proposal
- Shared the the consortium technical roadmap + minutes (Fujitsu, BCG, Dataiku, Nvidia)

### Guillaume

- Make some triaging + triage meeting with Tim
- Prepare the different PRs for the release 1.1.3
- One HP computer is in Saclay (other are ordered)
- Work on reviewing `HDBSCAN`:
    - Open a PR on the PR of Meekail - make a proper dispatching dense/sparse and optimize sparse: https://github.com/Micky774/scikit-learn/pull/5
- PyData Meetup
- Off on Friday

### Julien

- Reviewed Newton Cholesky solver from Christian: merged yesterday! üéâ
- ASV bench for various PRs for `PairwiseDistancesReductions` which includes:
    - Remove memoryview slicing (potential performance improvement): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24715
- [SLEP019](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/74)  follow-ups
- Follow-up on old PRs for float32 tests
    - Mergeable:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22667
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22671
    - Being adaptated:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22669
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22665
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22673
- Opened [a RFC for converting list of list of number to numpy arrays](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24745)
- Joint work with Vincent on the CSR-CSR case for Euclidean specialisation
- Various reviews and responses to ping in issues and PRs


### Vincent

- First survival models and benchmark on [SODA's repo](https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark) w/ Olivier. We beat by a tiny margin the brier score of PyCox best Neural Net model, with a simple grid of binary classifiers.
- On dirty_cat, tests on min and latest dependencies version are now available and awaiting for additionnal reviews, [PR](https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/pull/365).
- Benchmark of Nearest Neighbors brute algorithm in the Euclidean case with X_csr and Y_csr w/ Julien, we beat our baseline time performance by 1 order of magnitude but for now are worse in high dimension (> 500).

### Lo√Øc

- sklearn PyPI package: https://github.com/scikit-learn/sklearn-pypi-package. Good to upload to PyPI with a brownout starting December 1st?
- continuing work on Pyodide tests https://github.com/lesteve/scikit-learn-tests-pyodide
  + CI to build on scikit-learn main branch
  + investigated some non reproducible beaviour and opened https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/3203
- opened joblib PR to switch default backend with an environment variable https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1356, need to add a CI entry
- Inria Academy session Thursday and Friday afternoon
- holidays next week
