### Olivier

- Submitted a 45min talk on intro to time series forecasting with
  scikit-learn at OSXP (thanks Francois!)
- Compat fixes for next numpy and scipy version
  => will need to release [scikit-learn 1.1.2](
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=+milestone%3A1.1.2+) soonish. 
- Review / pair programmed with Julien on the implementation of sparse distance computation (WIP).

- Fine testing of GLM models (with the default LBFGS solver) [#23619](
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23619) and relation between intercept init, ability to converge to the minimum norm solution, and convergence speed and numerical stability explored in [this side PR](
  https://github.com/lorentzenchr/scikit-learn/pull/7).
- Reading about various Brier score loss decompositions including the work by SODA members on the grouping loss that was presented last week.
