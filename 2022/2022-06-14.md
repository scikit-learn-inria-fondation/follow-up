## June 14 2022

### Gael

- Prepared technical details plateforme IA (with François, Olivier)
    - Interpretability / explainability: difficult to know what to implement where
- Went to the big boss meeting of "Stratégie Nationale IA"
- Tried to move forward with pending candidate for job:
    - Sent email giving the ranking
    - Asked big bosses for authorization to hire even though it is not certain that we have the money

### Olivier

- Roadmap discussion for the scikit-learn part of the French AI project with Gael & Francois
- Review sprint
    - https://github.com/orgs/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/projects/2
    - in particular: ARFF parser quotes, quasi equality for float32 neighbors, group time series CV split, design review for the new class hierarchy for pairwise argkmin & friends
- Live review with Arturo on the document clustering example
- Related to the [newton solvers PRs](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23314): found out synthetic cases where LBFGS converges much slower than newton solvers: binary features with rare ones that are still informative and no correlated to other features
- Community office hours: discussed evaluation to do to be able to review oblique forests PR, discussed various pending PRs (trust-ngc, MDS fixes, ndcg deprecation on negative values)

### Julien

- 32bit on hold, addressing reviews first for:
    - MAINT Introduce dispatchers for `PairwiseDistancesReductions` https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23515 
    - MAINT Module reorganisation: https://github.com/jjerphan/scikit-learn/pull/14

- Reviewable (fails only for Linux_Docker debian_atlas_32bit?):
    - CSR support for all `DistanceMetric`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23604

- Follow up PRs:
    - Fused dense-sparse support for `PairwiseDistancesReduction`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23585

- Various reviews
- EuroPython synchronisation

### Jérémie
- sprint 8th/9th. Param validation, pairwise distance reduction, float32 tests
- Param validation: allow to skip validation
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23602
- Param validation: common test for public functions
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23514
- Reviews for param validation (received ~20 PRs already)
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3AValidation
  How to deal with `bool` ? doc says bool, but we sometimes accept np.bool_ or int.

### Guillaume

- sprint: as others :) + Hellinger criterion (the PR is buggy)
    - param validation: mypy failure?
- community office hours
- small meeting jupyter + EdX

### François

- OSXP 22 find people to submit a proposal
- Prepare technical details for plateforme IA with Gaël and Olivier
- French National AI Strategy Day
- PyData Paris meetup

### Arturo

- MOOC:
    - forum feedback fixes [!67](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/67), [!68](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/68) and formatting [#638](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/638)
    - [new notes](https://notes.inria.fr/_cdXjV3_TtGcfjipTi0Zfw#) on questions with score < 60% in session 2
- scikit-learn:
    - sprint: text clustering [#23528](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23528)

### Loïc

- make linkcheck usable: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23577. Fixed links with anchors: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23611. Planning to open a meta-issue about all the broken links.
- broken scipy-dev build to be investigated https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23614. Fix to script creating the issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23615
- nogil: trying to run the distributed tests and report the issues: https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/issues/66 https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/issues/67
- played with Jupyterlite and Pyodide with the long-term idea of replacing Binder for the jupyter-book. Discussion about Jupyter + OpenEdX tomorrow
- fix CI for MOOC (github action was still using Python 3.7) https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/639
