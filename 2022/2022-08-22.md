### Discussion


### TODO retrospective

- Mostly sync with people in the team (Julien, Olivier)

- Clean-up / update old issues reported on Intel repos now that we understand the cause of the past problems: mostly UX / error messages / packaging and doc to improve (Olivier)
- Interview candidate (Olivier, Francois)
- Review all pending scikit-learn PRs by Inria and core team :) (Olivier)
- Contribute to docstring PR in sklearn https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21350 (Franck)
- Move forward on gpu kmeans next todos (Franck, SODA):
  + benchmarks
  + integration with scikit-learn
  + finer optimizations
- Extend and review the document for the reply to the "Lettre de Mission" as part of the French National AI Strategy (François)
- Discuss MLOps workshop (Franck, Olivier, François)
- Keep tackling increasingly more ambitious PR to get up to speed (Vincent)
- Start testing survival analysis libraries and looking at their implementation, draft a note to design our estimators (Vincent)
- Some admin to address: get a Airbnb spot for EuroScipy (Vincent, Olivier)
- EuroSciPy: MOOC, model evaluation tutorials, time series analysis (Arturo, Olivier)
- Maybe work on pinball loss refactorization ? (Arturo)

### Franck

- First PRs! Contributed to the numpy_doc PR. [1](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24161) [2](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24162) [3](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24162) [4](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24164)
- Wrapped up most of [the implementation for kmeans benchmarks](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/2), got preliminary results

### Loïc

- fix binder setup: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24173. I pushed directly in 1.1.X branch. Do we want to use released version in 1.1.X?
- Ubuntu atlas failure debug: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24131#issuecomment-1208091119. Works with OpenBLAS. Not sure about how to fix/work-around.
- Another Ubuntu atlas issue fixed by Julien: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24168
- scipy-dev build should be green tomorrow thanks to https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24141

### Vincent

- Reviewing survival analysis theory (finish Princeton course and lifeline doc)
- Reading survival implementation with XGBoost (AFT XGBoost & XGBSE)
