## March 22nd 2022

### Julien
Off yesterday and today.

Apart recovering from the flu and some shapeless punnery, I started some work which is necessary:
 - [Adapt scheduling of `PairwiseDistancesRadiusNeighborhood`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22829#issuecomment-1072568854)
 - Meta-issue: [Improve tests to make them run on variously typed data using the `global_dtype` fixture](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22881) + associated PRs (I might need a break)

Reviews/Maintenance:
 - [DOC Rework plot_ard.py example](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22747), a nice rework from Arturo 
 - Migrating datastructures and sorting utilities for Decision Trees and Binary Search Trees

Remainder for [EuroPython 2022](https://program.europython.eu/europython-2022/submit/tpCODl/info/):
 - Dead line for CFP: "27 March 23:59:59 AoE (anywhere on earth)"
 - Currently have submitted a proposal for the team work on performance (I still need to edit it)
 - **Decision: Early Bird tickets can be bought**: https://ep2022.europython.eu/tickets
