## June 7 2022

### Gael

- Small work on plateform IA stuff: defining the roles of the different work packages
- Small issue / PR on doc
- Frank Charras is joining us
- Submitted to Euroscipy: one tutorial on model evaluation with Arturo and one talk on prediction with missing values
- Next Monday: workshop on strategy nationale IA, must present plateformes

### Julien

 - Helped Arturo with his setup
 - Various PR reviews
 - Logistique EuroPython 2022
 - Can't focus (sorry)


### Arturo

- MOOC:
    - started working on proceedings for ECML
- scikit-learn:
    - Good old session of tips with Julien
    - text clustering with Olivier [#23528](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23528)
- was off on Friday for viral reasons

### Olivier

- covid (but feeling better now)
- submitted a tutorial on time series forecasting for EuroSciPy
- investigated behavior of the new newton solvers on ill-conditioned GLM problems:
    - https://github.com/lorentzenchr/scikit-learn/pull/6
    - reading related chapters in Nocedal & Wright
- investigated and reported regression in scipy dev that's causing the nightly build failure:
    - https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16365
- document clustering review: found a problem related to kmeans++, sparse vectors and silhouette clustering (bug?) #23528
    - to make the build log faster to load / scroll: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23557
- failed to focus enough on GPU plugin project


### Jérémie

- reviews for param validations (ref https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23462)
  What to do with stateless estimators ?
- Fix param validation common test when 2 interval constraints
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23513
- Common test for param validation of public functions
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23514
- Allow to mark a constraint as internal, for unofficial supported types of some params (eg criterion in trees)
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23558
  
### François

- Interactions with HuggingFace.
- Created a google calendar for the consortium: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=MXJmdDNiNTJtcWVtYTEzc3JhZjVqaWxpa29AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ 
- Poll about next TC sent via mailchimp + invitation to submit something at OSXP 22
- Admin: HP, HR, EuroPython logistic

### Loïc

- mostly CI stuff and easy reviews
- broken links in the doc, looking at how to configure `make linkcheck` to more useful
- nogil segmentation fault with distributed tests. Wild guess: the distributed profiler is doing something CPython-specific. If someone wants to have a closer look at it with me, let me know ;-)

### Reminder

- Mini review sprint Wednesday 8th - Thursday 9th.
  Room Emmy Noether. project board https://github.com/orgs/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/projects/2/views/1
