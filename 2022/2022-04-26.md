- preparing the release.
  - I will block the release until MiniBatchNMF is merged :D
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948

  - need to make sure that the new fixtures global_dtype and global_random_seed don't break tests (spoiler: they do).
- From scipy mailing list, Ralf Gommers "under-maintained SciPy submodules and what to do about them". In particular scipy.sparse.linalg

### Loïc

- off last week
- CI lock files needs decision and/or inputs: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22448#issuecomment-1091873426. Is the CI stability worth the additional complexity + ~1-2 MiB per year in repo size growth?

### Anouncement

    - A good opportunity to highlight scikit learn especially in the Data Transformation track: [Call for speakers](https://sessionize.com/open-source-experience-2022/) is already opened!
    - Inria will share a room for presentations and workshops. We will have half a day there and need to prepare a schedule of demos/introduction to contribution/dev sprint depending on what we prefer.
