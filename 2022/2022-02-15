## February 15th

### Olivier

- MOOC videos / pending reviews: done!
- Fixed loky unstable CI: [#348](https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/348) [#349](https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/349)
    - all stable now!
- Thinking about what should be the expected data-shape / API for `precision_at_k` [#22431](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22431) and other ranking metric to make them compatible with our scoring / model evaluation / model selection tools.
- Thinking about the design for the pluggable computation routines:
    - [#22438](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22438)
    - Trying to make my intel devcloud ssh config work again...
    - Need to draft with Francois a comm' doc for our collaboration with Intel

### Jérémie
- tried adding coverage for cython files (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22439). Fail...
- Reviews. Do you know the "quick review" label ?
    - It was added by Thomas :)
- discussed with Thomas about reducing overhead of Parallel(n_jobs=1)
- finally got back to the callback API, currently consolidating the example callbacks.
- waiting for reviews NMF and adding stopping criteria to MiniBatchDictLearning https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18975 and https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948

### Guillaume

- Reviews PRs + updating a couple my PRs
- TODO
    - Would like to spend some time looking again at the Pipeline API: `Pipeline.from_fitted_pipeline(...)`

### Gael

- Teaching, used scikit-learn-mooc, was great (binder integration)
- Moving forward with strategy national IA (current status: finalizing "lettre de mission")
- A PR on reordering metrics in documentation (I vote against alphabetic ordering: most important first), and discouraging the use of "explained_variance_score"
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22491

### Loïc

- MOOC
- Using pinned dependencies in CI with auto-update bot [#22425](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22425). Started a PR [#22488](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22448) using conda-lock. A couple of CI clean-up PRs while working on this.
- joblib memmap arrays alignment [#1254](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1254) to finalise
- Use notebook-style in more examples [#22406](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22406)
