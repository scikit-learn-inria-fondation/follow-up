### Gael

- Helped out a bit on the WIMLDS sprint
- Met with foundation for update
- Simplified the [text classification example](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/text/plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.html).
    - It should be made yet more didactic: it is our only text-classification example
    - We could first demo on one classifier, then benchmark all of them
- Will task Jovan on complete scott and silverman bandwidth for Kernel Density Estimators https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/10468
- TODO: recruiting profile for Intel position (with Julien & Olivier)
    - https://notes.inria.fr/e2eo0_zPTaKArFjAWp0rZw#

### Olivier

- Helped with the WiMLDS sprint (and still reviewing PRs)
- Contributed new fixture to make tests seed insensitive
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22749
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22827 (tracking issue for using the new fixture)
- Continue review of Array API spec support:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22554
- Continue review of Cython losses for Poisson and co:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22548
- Fixed problems on the SHAP vs permutation importance example
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18139
- Reviewed some PRs mentionned by others below

Next:
- Hiring for the Intel collab
- Continue reviews related to pitfalls of model inspection to help Guillaume tutorial
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19789 (warning about causal interpretations)
- Ongoing reviews
- Follow-up with Mathis to start reporting main performance problems reavealed by his benchmarks

### Arturo
- MOOC:
    - some forum/small PR review
    - forum feedback fix: [#609](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/609)
- scikit-learn:
    - quick reviews
    - examples revamping: plot_ard [#22747](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22747)
    - currently reading about prevalence in likelihood ratios

### Jérémie
- reviews for 1.1
  - replace if_delegate_has_method done. Now deprecate
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22830
  - changing default config for estimator repr in notebooks -> 'diagram'
    ongoing, PR soon
- reviewed new fixtures (random seed, [dtypes](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22690))
- Common param validation. Looking better
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22722
- I'd like to come up with a definitve answer to KMedians https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22709. Asked many times, several PRs. Main issue: center update is an optimisation problem in itself. Is it in the scope ? should we redirect to sklearn-contrib / extra ?
- wanna procrastinate ? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22761
