### Gael

Done:

- Reviewed PR on likelihood test ratio
- Reviewed long-term economic perspectives with Francois and Jean-Michel Lefevre
- Hiring for Intel position

To do:
- Will be in NYC and see Reshama (and Thomas)
- Hiring for Intel position

### Olivier

- Benchmarked the new newton solver for Poisson regression:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23314#pullrequestreview-968769894
    - Promising but I do not quite understand what in this regression problem make the LBFGS comparatively fail so dramatically (100x or more slower)
- Read Christian's paper on model evaluation:
    - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12780
    - Now reading: https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2016191118 on binless calibration curves and proper scoring rules (e.g. Brier) decomposition into (auto-)miscalibration, refinement and irreducible Brier loss.
    - Related issues:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23132
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21774
- More nogil testing and failure reports:
    - https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aogrisel
    - everything has been fixed, included Loic's report on the pytest internal error
- Array API spec: interesting discussion on the capabilities of the new numpy rng API w.r.t. parallel works (threads vs process)
