### Gael

- Progress on moving Guillaume to Saclay
- Aligning vision with JM Lefevre and the rest of SNAI
- Cython+ meeting

### François

- Inria welcome morning 
- Met the Fondation Inria to co-operate on patronage funds and renewals (transmission of files, explanation of some processes). We also had a point about making the membership corresponding to the fiscal year. 
- Met and aligned some of the scikit-learn communication workflows with Lauren. It would be nice that we have a small budget even to pay for tools like Buffer or templates for instance. 
- First contact with [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com). They are interesting about writing an article about democratization of ML and would ask us to present in fancy way some of the scikit-learn features for the layman. Someone interested?
- Continued meetings for SNAI
- Met HuggingFace with Gaël, they will join us as a Silver Member.
- Sync with AXA for the 11th of May. Guillaume and Adrin will give a talk about interpretability.

### Arturo

- scikit-learn:
    - mini-sprint: reviews, compare bayesian regressions [#22747](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22747)
    - tried and failed solving covtype issue [#23048](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23048)
    - revamping pos/neg likelihood ratios [#22518](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22518)

### Julien

- Spending time going through recruiting for Intel
- Retaking my work for 32bit 
- Practic
- Conting properly phrasing my frustration

### Jérémie
- review sprint (8 PRs merged). Milestone is not empty yet :)
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/43
  3 "big" PRs left:
  - interaction constraints to hgbt
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21020
  - minibatch nmf (missing 1 reviewer)
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948
  - bisecting kmeans (almost ready)
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20031
- global_dtype fixture in all CI jobs for nightly builds
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23110
  but I missed that the azure cron job only runs on linux. Shouldn't it run all jobs ?
- make it possible to run only selected tests but for all random seeds
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23026
- off the rest of the week

### Olivier

- review sprint
    - found about backward compat problem in dtype for target in pandas ARFF parser 
    - improved doc tree loss doc:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23081
- a bit of MOOC forum follow-up
- hiring reviews / interview planning
- learning jax by implementing a single Lloyd step:
    - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ptwTiQfq6xoBOdAA27rE_Gs7DNb4xafS
    - so far: jax code can be faster (on colab) on GPU than on single thread CPU
    - but jax CPU is much slower than sklearn's Cython on CPU
- off Friday
