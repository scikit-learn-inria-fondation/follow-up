### Arturo

Off for two weeks

### Loïc

Off for two weeks

### Francois
- Was off last week
- Reading/replying to emails
- Meeting with Berger-Levrault, one of the strategic partner of Inria (https://www.berger-levrault.com/fr/)

### Guillaume

- Off last week
- Solve issues with broken CIs
- Addressing some comments on PRs
- Feedback regarding retour-mission


### Olivier

- Surveyed conda(-forge) packaging related issues for the Intel GPU / numba-dpex stack: many pieces to fix and update but nothing very hard to fix (I think)
- Progress on engine plugin system:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24497
- Prepared a bit SODA retreat by exploring the big housing dataset:
    - https://github.com/ogrisel/us-housing-prices-v2-parquet/blob/main/us-housing-prices-v2-EDA.ipynb
- Reviewed Vincent benchmarking results on survival analysis methods


### Jérémie

- mostly reviews: PredictionErrorDisplay, PairwiseDistance, use global_random_seed in tests, numpydoc val for displays
- callbacks API (a little): make sure everything cleans-up nicely when error or interrupted. Open the way for interruptable fit.
- more deprecation clean-up. There are a few left
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24404
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24395
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24391
- reviewing float32 preservation in transformers. LDA

### Gael

- Worked a bit on the document for the French gov
- Going to Brusselles for sovereign AI & cloud on Tues

### Julien

- `PairwiseDistancesReduction`:
    - [FEA Introduce PairwiseDistances](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23958)
        - as a preliminary: [#24502 RFC Should pairwise_distances preserve float32 ?](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24502)
    - Cython onboarding sessions for optimisating [the Euclidean case on fused sparse-dense datasetspair](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/metrics/_pairwise_distances_reduction/_dispatcher.py#L122-L137) (w. Vincent)
    - Misc/Clean-up PR: to come
- [Scientific Python -- Sparse data Summit](https://scientific-python.org/summits/sparse/) (w. Jérémie and Meekail)
    -  [First meeting yesterday](https://scientific-python.org/summits/sparse/meeting1/): maintainers exposing their usage and needs -- see [the presentation for scikit-learn's](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scientific-python/scientific-python.org-blobs/main/summits/sparse/meeting1/julien-jerphanion.pdf)
    -  Next meeting (TBD): moving toward the specification of common API based on projects' needs
- Governance update (w. Gaël): waiting for feedback of people in the team
    - [SLEP](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/74)
    - [Draft PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24444)
- `sklearn-numba-dpex`:
    - Reviews of several of Franck's PRs
- Various other things
    - approved [the first HDBSCAN PR targetting the `hdbscan` feature branch](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22616)
    - submitted a project proposal for the team retreat 
- Off on Friday afternoon

### Franck
- Completed the kmeans GPU functions for prediction [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/15)
- Implemented part of the sklearn strategy for empty clusters [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/19)
- Worked with Olivier on the draft of a plugin system in sklearn + using it for KMeans [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24497)
- Using the plugin system, plugged `sklearn_numba_dpex` in `sklearn`, including a system to easily test custom engines against `sklearn` unit tests ! [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/20)
- The KMeans POC is almost complete with a nice template for the future GPU projects !!
- Worked with Vincent on the packaging project for dirty-cat [PR](https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/pull/365)
- Roadmap toward pip-installation of `sklearn_numba_dpex` and `numba_dpex` [issue](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/775)
- Various interesting feedback from intel on several issues ([loop unrolling](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/770), [async dispatching](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/769))

### Vincent
- I have found a large dataset (+2m) for survival analysis and started using with our custom survival models. This will result in a tutorial w/ Olivier.
- Packaging PR on dirty_cat w/ Frank
- A ton of learning about Cython thanks to Julien, ready to start contributing. This will be helpful to implement Cox and AFT losses survival in Cython
