### TODO Retrospective

- SODA Retreat (everybody)
- Follow-up on PRs highlighted in the scikit-learn monthly meeting:
    - https://hackmd.io/0yokz72CTZSny8y3Re648Q?both (olivier)
    - implementation SLEP006 (Guillaume)
    - implementation SLEP018 (Guillaume)
- Prepare slides for introducing MLOps at the MLOps workshop (Franck)
- Small iterations on GPU KMeans (support `sample_weight` & add prediction method to the plugin in sklearn side) (Franck)
- Communication about our partnership with HuggingFace (François)
- Follow up Technical Committee and MLOps workshop (François)
- Devis HP (Guillaume, François)
- `PairwiseDistancesReduction` clean-up (Julien)
- continue reviews "preserve float32 in transformers" (Jérémie)
- callbacks api, slowly but steady (Jérémie)

### Gaël

- Strategie Nationale IA (with Francois)
- Working on Jérémie long-term contract again
- Romain Girard not taking the job :(. We need to find someone else

### Loïc

- work on running the tests inside Pyodide
  https://github.com/lesteve/scikit-learn-tests-pyodide and hack session with
  Roman. Current status, plenty of test errors, some of the tests crash nodejs,
  which makes it cumbersome to run tests (for now run separate command for each
  submodule). According to Roman, nodejs crashes probably are an issue with
  scipy. Need to create an issue with a reproducer so that Pyodide maintainers
  can debug it.
- feed-back wanted on sklearn deprecation brownout
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/sklearn-pypi-package
  + it would be nice to have an announcement via social media (maybe mailing
  list) with a period where people can test whether they will be affected.
  + right now start is November 1st? Is it too soon? Does it need to be
    discussed at the next core developer meeting?
- PRs needing reviews for scikit-learn fixes:
  + https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24682 to fix build
    without OpenMP e.g. Pyodide build. Opened https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/24694 to track how to have the "no OpenMP" build actually be without OpenMP.
  + https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24693 for temporarily
    disabling the conda defaults openblas build. Currently this build fails on
    all the PRs until
    https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/13075 is fixed.
- scikit-learn documentation build fix (already merged):
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24654
- joblib: started looking at changing default backend with environment
  variable. Goal is to be able to test python nogil by running the joblib and
  the scikit-learn tests with threading as the default backend
- loky: opened https://github.com/joblib/loky/issues/37 to track issue
  where GridSearchCV does not show progress output.
- MOOC:
  + Creating a github release, DOI from Zenodo, and adding the "how to cite us"
    info in https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/668
  + a bit of clean-up moving issues to to MOOC 4.0 milestone
- Willow/Sierra retreat Wednesday to Friday
