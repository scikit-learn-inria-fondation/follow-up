    - PyLadies
    - INRIA Academy
- PR's:
    - DOC Rework KMeans assumptions example [#24970](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24970)
    - DOC Rework feature scaling example [#25012](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25012)

### Jérémie

- Release 1.2.0rc1.
  - missing binaries for python 3.11 on conda-forge
    https://github.com/conda-forge/scikit-learn-feedstock/pull/204
  - got an increased of project limit size on PyPI to 20GB.
    we should clean-up some old stuff (old RCs ?, everything on testpypi ?)
- KMeans default n_init: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25022
  Should we change it for estimators that initialize with KMeans and expose n_init ?

### François

### Franck

- `sklearn_numba_dpex`:
	+ interoperability with `dpnp` and `dpt.tensor.usm_ndarray` [merged](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/62)
	+ fix kmeans++ benchmark for daal [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/63)
	+ [WIP](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/65): engine stores kmeans fitted attribute as `dpt.usm_ndarray` arrays rather than numpy array
- Relevant discussions:
    - sklearn issue [configurability of default array library for Array API](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25000)
    - [dpctl issue](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/997) for support on missing pieces of the Array API
