## April 5th 2022

### Gael

- A lot of thinking / reading on evaluating models with class imbalance / low prevalence
- Contact with huggingface for consortium

### Julien

 - Spent time on reviewing applications for Intel.
 - Spent time debugging audio and video problem on video conferences (problem I have since updating the BIOS of my machine).
 - Reported a bug for Cython, spending some time in the issue tracker.
 - Rebasing Pull-Requests for 32bit:
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22764
     - adapting https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22590 on recent changes
 - Question: would it make sense to do a TODO retrospective for weekly meetings? This way we could know what blocks from moving on.
 - Question: Mathis is not responding. How can we move on from here?

### Olivier

- Started to prototype engine registration in branch using importlib and the `sklearn.config_context` system (still WIP, need to use it in kmeans and write a dummy plugin with numba-dppy or similar):
    - https://github.com/ogrisel/scikit-learn/tree/wip-engines
    - reported packaging issues for dpnp and numba-dppy:
        - https://github.com/IntelPython/dpnp/issues/1149
        - https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dppy/issues/742
- Trying to follow Guillaume's SHAP adventures (a few papers lagging)
- Reviewed Arturo's PR on document classification example
- Various reviews

### Jérémie
- review BisectingKMeans (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20031)
- local testing for global_random_seed is not enough. PR to make it possible to run the CI on a subset of tests but for all random seeds
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23026
  (goal: make a gh action to trigger that based on some comment in a PR)
- renamed triage team -> contributor experience team
- question regarding global_dtype fixture: (https://mattermost.inria.fr/parietal/pl/oeupsppdxty4ux6zjbm36o61th)

### Arturo

- MOOC:
    - some forum
    - forum feedback fixes: [#615](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/615) and [#617](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/617)
- scikit-learn:
    - quick reviews leading to issue [#23048](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23048)
    - revamping examples: plot document classification [#22928](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22928)
    - discussion and reading on pos/neg likelihood ratios

### François
- SNAI: meeting with AIE4EU, and Kevin Kok Heang from DGE (Bercy)

### Guillaume

- Focusing on PyData Berlin tutorial
- Solving logistic problem for PyData Berlin

### Loïc

- still working on CI lock files https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22448. I tried to estimate lockfile churn impact on repo size, but not really trusting my repo size estimates anymore ...
