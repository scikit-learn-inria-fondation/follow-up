### Franck

- Meeting with Tim for synchronizing work about array api:
    - overall agreement
    - Tim wishes to work more on the interface on the sklearn side rather than developing actual plugins
- Kmeans merged + many fixes, improvements, and refacto [1](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/58) [2](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/57) [3](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/55) [4](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/53) [5](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/51) [6](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/51) [7](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/50) [8](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/49) [9](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/49) [10](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/48) [11](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/60)
