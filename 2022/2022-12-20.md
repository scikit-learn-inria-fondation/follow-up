### Gael

- Seen people in Austin
- Journée science ouverte
- Mathis contract (to finish)
- TODO: rapport d'équipe
- Office space (to finish, with François)
- skabular (Lilian)

### Guillaume

- ECOC / `OutputCodeClassifier`:
    - Reviewing the addition of `predict_proba`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25148
    - Use `ArgKMin` pattern: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25196
    - Went into the literature:
        - `predict` is wrong: (i) L2 distance instead of L1, (ii) collision in codebook generation, (iii) does not make sense to use `decision_function`.
        - implemented `predict_proba`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25148#issuecomment-1355268002 based on Zadrozny et al. 
- Trying to fix the CI with `scipy-dev`:
    - Python 3.11 `importlib` stuff
    - SciPy `eigvals` deprecation
    - Deprecation from `kulsinski` to `kulczynski1`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25212
        - Change of distance definition
        - Breaking with `BallTree`
- Review a bit SLEP019
- Some other reviews

### Franck

- Update sklearn-numba-dpex to latest changes on sklearn branch [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/74)
    - discussion going on about input validation
- Run [Sasha implementation](https://github.com/oleksandr-pavlyk/kmeans_dpcpp/) of kmeans in C++ 
    - runs fine on gpu, unittests OK
    - opened a [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/75) to add it to our benchmark, runs but with issues
- Maintenance work linked to intel packages releases:
    - good news: all pypi.org and conda packages (from intel channel) bumped to 2023.0.0
    - bad news: non compatible with 2022.0.0, breaks lots of things, some still unsolved
        - [dpctl needs rebuild](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1022)
        - [dpctl/numba_dpex not compatible with libsycl.so.6](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1023)
    - pinned to <2023 for our conda install guide
    - docker image kept broken for CPU
- Meeting with intel:
    - perspective to get access to discrete GPUs in intel dev cloud
- [Meeting with Tim](https://hackmd.io/--MJTgQzSFSYaaAgcJWQZg?edit)
- Ticket on issues with ubuntu build of intel compute runtime [seems to be under investigation](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/issues/588)
- review state of the art of KNN:
    - [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/) good reference implementation, code very readable
    - Considering [Dr. TopK](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3183713.3183735?casa_token=qebx_N62mYoAAAAA:7w9gEu0K9zL76lSzHwyx3DojNZlMN1K-3DCALmSJeWwT3LRqIREbRcm_CjqZXnv8_-eNG5xWWBQ) for TopK implementation
- Suggestion to have `order` argument in [Array API](https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/571)

### Loïc

- MOOC
  + Use github action + netlify for PR preview (instead of CircleCI). See https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/blob/main/.github/workflows/jupyter-book-pr-preview.yml for more details
  + forum
- Pyodide
  + try to compile OpenBLAS and use it in scipy, still not working https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3331. Some OpenBLAS fixes as by-product https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/3861
  + understand a bit better scipy tests Pyodide fatal errors https://github.com/lesteve/scipy-tests-pyodide
- scikit-learn: reviews for scipy-dev fixes

### Vincent

- Setup work computer and connection HPC clusters
- Run ASV benchmark on margaret for [ArgKmin and RadiusNeighbors Euclidean revamp](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25170) and will sync w/ Meekail since he's working on a similar revamp
- Need to move fast on the survival benchmark (TODO)

### TODO

- Mathis contract (Gael)
- TODO: rapport d'équipe (Gael)
- Office space (Gael with François)
- get back to sphinx-gallery Jupyterlite integration (Loïc) https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/977
- Open PRs to solve `OutputCodeClassifier` (Guillaume)
