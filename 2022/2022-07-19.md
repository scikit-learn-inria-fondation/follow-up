### Arturo

### Jérémie
- off last week
- back to param validation reviews.
  @glemaitre second review for https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23772 ?
- off august


### François
- EuroPython 22
    - First Python conference (9/10): I realised how important and essential these events are to build a community and foster efficient collaboration/projects/share knowledge.
    - Met many different people/profiles, got to know more Guillaume, Arturo, Julien that was also really cool.
    - Spent working and informal times with other maintainers or people involved (Adrin, Maren, Roman) helps the project feel less like an inria team. Also spending these informal and working times with new contributors from the sprint help them identify to the project and long term contribution.
    - On-boarding EuroSciPy
    - Communication on site and on social media.
    - One observation: few research people, lots of devs from the industry/freelancers

### Loïc

- Fix Ubuntu build for all global random seeds https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23957
- bit of MOOC
- opinions on "how to cite us" for the MOOC JupyterBook https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/651

### Franck

- Released a Dockerfile for numba_dpex environment and hosted the image on inria internal registry
- collect and read documentation on gpu programming and kmeans programming, tutorial-level of numba_dpex programming
- quick performance tests for sklearn-intelex kmeans
