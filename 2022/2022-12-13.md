### Loïc

- Pyodide workshop :-) with Covid :-(
  + Try to pakage OpenBLAS in Pyodide and use it in scipy https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3331. The hope is it will get rid of weird low-level issues. Still in progress.
  + debugged and reported an issue with JupyterBook thebe integration: https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/issues/583
- JupyterCon abstract for MOOC talk: https://notes.inria.fr/vUJi0kcxS_WZBiA0zr8Ylg
- opened issue in `oldest-supported-numpy` about packaging edge case, but it seems like we can not do much about it. https://github.com/scipy/oldest-supported-numpy/issues/67#issuecomment-1348260646. Original issue in scikit-learn Fedora packages numpy 1.22 with Python 3.11 + `pip install scikit-learn` => API version error: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25159.
 

### Olivier

- Last pyladies mentoring session, I think people liked it.
- Pyodide/jupyterlite workshop:
    - Building OpenBLAS with emscripten
    - Discussions on:
        - constraints on the use of main thread vs webworkers for notebook environment and impact on blocking IO calls such as the `input` builtin and `time.sleep`
        - use of WASM for teaching programming in French highschools by Capytale and https://basthon.fr/
    - Packaging wheels for Pyodide and in particular how to ship native libraries inside wheels
    - Coordination about architecture flags to allow Python wasm packages on pypi.org and/or conda-forge one day
- Meeting on survival analysis at BNP Paribas Cardif
    - Clarified how the model with the Poisson trick works
    - Clarified how they needed fused-lasso style penalization for the impact of the one-hot encoded time bin features of this model to enforce a smooth survival function prior
    - Clarified how they want to deal with competing risks:
        - One event of interest, other events are more like nuisance that introduce a bias in the time to even regression
        - Still want to compute the survival function / IBS metric but only relative to the event of interest with a smart adjustment to deal with competing risks
        - Discsussion about business metrics to compare the relative performance of different models: it's quite complex
- Various post 1.2.0 bugfix PR reviews
- Tried to resume work on automated categorical features support for HGBRT but not satisfied with my design (circular dependencies between input and `categorical_features` parameter validation that leads to complex code...): paused.
- Will be off till January 2nd starting Thursday and teaching tomorrow.


### Vincent

- Draft [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25170) of the euclidean specialization of `DatasetsPair` (replacing `Euclidean{ArgKmin, RadiusNeighbors}`)
    - I need to setup my new work laptop to run asv on 128 cores
- Meeting with BNP Paribas Cardif w/ Olivier about Survival Analysis
- Introduce survival analysis during today Mind's [lightning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z_NvOXzOjzjHUL7WfK7pg9F74SnXZhdCKMLf9msAqtM/edit#slide=id.p)
- No days off but remote until ~5 January

Next: survival benchmarks 

### Franck

- Iteration on `sklearn_numba_dpex` installation guide [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/68) (almost merged)
- Investigation on releasing conda packages from our custom sklearn branch and plugin
- Conversation with Vladimir Kostarev
    - progress on access to relevant hardware
    - planning of a meeting with intel oneapi product team (Jan. 2023)
- Planning a meeting with StarPU (Jan. 2023)
- Currently investigating deadlock in joblib `return_generator` PR

### Jérémie
- release 1.2.0
- reviews for missing param validation in a few estimators (PRs by Guillaume)
- reviews for param validation in functions. Painful for "class wrappers", especially https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24871
- off from 20th to 26th

### Guillaume

- release `imbalanced-learn` 0.10.0
- parameter validation for remaining validation
- fixing the CIs for scipy-dev stack
- reviews
- JupyterCon tutorial

### TODO/Next
- keep trying Pyodide OpenBLAS (Loïc)
- get back to sphinx-gallery Jupyterlite integration (Loïc) https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/977
