### Julien

- Participated to some Scientific Python discussions:
    - [Pooling contributors skills between open-source projects](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/pooling-contributors-skills-between-open-source-projects/381)
    - [Scientific python and sparse arrays (scipy summary + future directions)](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/scientific-python-and-sparse-arrays-scipy-summary-future-directions/368/)
- Some repo setup for [`sklearn-numba-dpex`](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex)
- Have been following Arturo, Vincent and Meekail work
- Reviewed various PRs
- Some remarks:
  - I would like to take time to review some PRs, namely:
      - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21020
      - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23314
      - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23595
    but I need to block some time (days).
    I am planning to do this during remote-work days, probably starting in September. 
  - Some PR can be reviewed/merged IMO:
      - ASV Add benchmarks for PairwiseDistancesReductions [#24120](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24120)
      - FEA Add support for float32 on PairwiseDistancesReduction using Tempita [#23865](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23865)
      - MAINT Adapt PairwiseDistancesReduction heuristic for `strategy="auto"` [#24043](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24043)
      - then merge `main` those PR for {sparse,dense}² support and reran benchmarks:
          - [MAINT Division-less alternative for fused sparse-dense support](https://github.com/jjerphan/scikit-learn/pull/15)
          - [FEA Fused sparse-dense support for `PairwiseDistancesReduction`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23585)
  - Off starting Thursday
  - :warning: [PyData Paris - September 2022 Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-paris/events/287683024/), with limited spot (37/50 left)


### Olivier

- Was off for more than two weeks
- Catching up with emails / mattermost and other notifications
- Been reading the SYCL book (still half of it to go)
- Reviewing ongoing work on the PoC for kmeans in numba-dpex:
    - https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/2
- Starting to review existing libraries on gradient boosted trees for survival analysis to be able to help Vincent

### Franck

- Was off for a week
- POC for gpu kmeans with numba-dpex fully written, overall encouraging perspectives
- Fixed atomic support within the numba_dpex docker image (https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/6)
- Setup a new computer

### Vincent

- Working remotely for 2 weeks
- First coding contribution in progress for `StackingClassifier`, a stalled issue
- Start reviewing major survival analysis libraries (lifelines, scikit-survival, pysurvival)
- Wrote a minimalistic tutorial for [contributing to scikit-learn](https://vincent-maladiere.github.io/contributing-to-scikit-learn.html) (comments are welcomed [here](https://vincentmaladiere.notion.site/Contributing-to-Scikit-Learn-215f2e8ec2264ac5ae4ab632fd359b00))


### François

- Was off for a week
- Worked on the answer to the "Lettre de Mission" for the French National AI strategy
- Working remotely this week


### Arturo

- scikit-learn:
    - cosine distances with Julien: [#24099](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24099)
    - reviewed [#24051](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24051)
- comm:
    - iter on EuroScipy tutorial
    - iter on ECML slides

### Discussion

- EuroSciPy AirBnB (second payment for the big one)
- Project board d'équipe, proposé par Franck

### TODO

- Mostly sync with people in the team (Julien, Olivier)
- Ping-pong of given and taken reviews (Julien)
- Clean-up / update old issues reported on Intel repos now that we understand the cause of the past problems: mostly UX / error messages / packaging and doc to improve (Olivier)
- Interview candidate (Olivier, Francois)
- Review all pending scikit-learn PRs by Inria and core team :) (Olivier)
- Contribute to docstring PR in sklearn https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21350 (Franck)
- Move forward on gpu kmeans next todos (Franck, SODA):
  + benchmarks
  + integration with scikit-learn
  + finer optimizations
- Extend and review the document for the reply to the "Lettre de Mission" as part of the French National AI Strategy (François)
- Discuss MLOps workshop (Franck, Olivier, François)
- Keep tackling increasingly more ambitious PR to get up to speed (Vincent)
- Start testing survival analysis libraries and looking at their implementation, draft a note to design our estimators (Vincent)
- Some admin to address: get a Airbnb spot for EuroScipy (Vincent, Olivier)
- EuroSciPy: MOOC, model evaluation tutorials, time series analysis (Arturo, Olivier)
- Maybe work on pinball loss refactorization ? (Arturo)
