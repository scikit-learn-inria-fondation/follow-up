### Gael

- Mostly coming back from vacations
- Présentation to data science academy of Denmark
- We sent the document of the national strategy to the gov. Let's see what comes out.

### Julien

 - `sklearn_dpex` / Intel :
     - reviewed 5 PRs from Franck, including KMeans++
     - Based on Jay's feedback and as briefly discussed with Franck IRL, we might want to do a retrospective and retroplanning before the next meeting with Intel.
     - Initial meeting to sync with Tim Head regarding plugins
 - [SLEP019](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/74): end of vote due on this Thursday @ 18:00 UTC, but no actionable. 
     - Proposal (discussed in meetings): get to the end of the vote period, reword or simplify, resubmit vote 
 - `PairwiseDistancesReductions` / Cython:
     - [EHN Optimized CSR-CSR support for `Euclidean` specializations of `PairwiseDistancesReductions`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24556), from Vincent
     - have been reviewing and mostly have +1'd this PR bringing significant speed-ups
     - syncing with Meekail regarding his work on Cython
 - a few small PRs I am looking reviewers for :
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24715
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24542
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24771
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22671
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22665
 - Doing/Next:
     - Superseding the [monotonic constraints PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13649) with Olivier 
     - Writing a comprehensive issues regarding removing all compilation warnings; 2 goals:
         - "good first Cython issue" for new contributors (see [this comment](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15474#issuecomment-1303279079))
         - more safety low-level code, especially Cython and reduced builds' logs' obfuscation

### Olivier

- Fixed small things related to dependency update:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24803
- Reviewed PR by Vincent on sparse distances in Cython
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24807
- GPU plugin meeting
- Reviewed tree `monotonic_cst` (part of last week's 1.2 sprint):
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13649
    - however the implementation seem to imposes too much constraints
      on the model: started investigating but more work is needed
- WIP: using feature names in `monotonic_cst` for HGBDT:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24855
    - common test / estimator check?
    - sphinx docstring warning...
- A bit of MOOC forum follow-up, mostly reading Arturo's replies :)
- TODO reviews:
    - 1.2 milestone PRs
    - Franck's PR on `sklearn_numba_dpex`,
    - Tim's PR on the engines
    - Part II of Vincent's work [#24556](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24556)
    - Julien's PRs
    - Probabilistic HistGBDT [#24810](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24810)
- TODO survival stuff with Vincent and calibration work with Alex P.
