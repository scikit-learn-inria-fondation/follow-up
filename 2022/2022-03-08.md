## March 8th 2022

### Gael

- Started: recruiting profile for Intel position (with Julien & Olivier)
    - https://notes.inria.fr/e2eo0_zPTaKArFjAWp0rZw#
- The comms team would like the blog to move forward
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22337
- I'm traveling the rest of the week


### Alex

- Alpha per feature in GLMs: [#11566](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/11566)

### Julien

- Synchronisation with Xavier for Cython+ for a weird bug à la [OpenBLAS#3187](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/3187): https://lab.nexedi.com/cython-plus/kdtree/merge_requests/1
- `PairwiseDistancesReduction` follow-ups, see issue [#22587](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22587):
     - Radius neighborhood [#22320](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22320): merged
     - float32 data support [#22590](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22590): first needs adaptations of tests for 32bit (grand chantier), thus see [comment regarding the original failing test](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22590#issuecomment-1054521388)
- WIP/Next: Implement the rest of follow-ups for `PairwiseDistancesReductions`
- WIP: Sync with Mathis
- WIP: Re-explore https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4217


### Loïc

- holidays
- Making the CI more stable through lock files: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22448
- Review of some notebook-style examples (meta-issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22406)
- a bit of MOOC
  + work-around about IPython 8 bug with `raise from` (so joblib with `n_jobs > 1`): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22704
  + looking at using piwik.inria.fr for MOOC JupyterBook audience measurement (who knows, it may replace Google Analytics for scikit-learn.org one day?)
  + I don't really think the auto-updating of the docker image is a great idea ... there must be a better way (maybe generate notebooks from python_scripts the first time the user space is created)
  + forum: marking topics as answered when relevant
- Inria-Academy session next week (Monday and Tuesday)

### François
