### Gael

Travelling.

### Olivier

+ Design meeting about engine API with Tim:
    + include automated fallback engine negotiation in mixin class
    + discussed coupling of engine negociation and fit-input validation
    + include standard way for engine to convert fitted attributes back to numpy
    + beyond this, no generic engine API at this point
+ Brainstormed with Arturo about how to improve the example about the impact of scaling the regularization parameter of l1-penalized and l2-penalized LinearSVC.
+ Some reviews for 1.2
+ Triage + Drafting meetings
    + https://hackmd.io/LODWgwO_Shu7QaSRa7cDKw?both
+ Spent some time preparing an updated notebook to teach seq2seq and GPT style training with PyTorch if you are interested:
    + https://www.kaggle.com/code/ogrisel/translation-of-numeric-phrases-with-seq2seq/

Next:

+ Continue reviews, in particular on Engine API
+ Pyodide workshop on Thursday and survival with BNP on Friday afternoon
+ PyLadies on Thursday evening
+ Will be off from 16/12/2022 to 02/01/2023

### Jérémie

- Follow-up RC 1.2.
  - tested downstream deps, looks like we only broke imbalanced-learn because of param validation. Fixed.
  - Another PR about param validation https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25087
    (better to include it in 1.2 for better backward compat)
    **last one before I can release**
  - clean-up old RCs in PyPI
- review param validation PRs for functions
- off december 20-26

### Loïc

- Inria Academy session done
- put a bit more thoughts into the Jupyterlite sphinx-gallery integration: https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/977
- enabled required checks and auto-merge on scikit-learn, complain in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25069 in case of unexpected issues
- Consolidating syncronous communication to one venue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25068
- a bit of MOOC, in particular double-check that 1.2.0rc1 did not break anything
- put a bit more thoughs into abstract for JupyterCon about MOOC setup
- disable wheel caching for sklearn PyPI package? https://github.com/scikit-learn/sklearn-pypi-package/pull/4. Seems quite hacky, for now only considering this if there is another good reason to do another release (0.0.post2)

Next: 
- Jupyterlite community workshop Wednesday through Friday
 
### Franck

- Merged last interoperability [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/65) on the roadmap: store fitted attribute with the underlying native array library type `dpctl.tensor.usm_ndarray`
- synchronization with Tim Head for forward development of features for the plugin system
- Investigation on `numba-dpex` conda packaging
    - write an up to date guide for conda installation [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/68)
    - plan to use the cleaner install process to add development `sklearn-numba-dpex` and `sklearn` distributions
    - deep investigation found a bug somewhere between intel, ubuntu and sycl: https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1010
    - possible dirty workaround
