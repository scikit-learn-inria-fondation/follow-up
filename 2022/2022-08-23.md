- Main focus:
  - Have [#24223](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24223) merged, then:
  - Perform benchmark against `main` for [#23585](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23585`)
  - Update presentation for EuroScipy w.r.t latest work on `PairwiseDistancesReduction` 
- Various help and synchronisation in the team
   - Give input on doc for SNAI to François
   - Introduce Cython and low-level aspects of the code-base to Vincent 
   - Review Franck's PR on KMeans using numba-dpex
   - Follow-up work with Arturo on CSR utils funcs
- As always, some (small and medium) PR reviews and small fixes here and there, e.g.:
    - [#24049](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24049): a small PR for some confort around Cython dev + potential performance improvement? 
- Next: Main focus + various help and synchronisation in the team

### François

- Worked on the National Strategy document
- Some posts for EuroSciPy on Twitter
    - https://twitter.com/sklearn_inria/status/1561996681066979330
- Follow up for the MLOps workshop
    - https://notes.inria.fr/rC4S4dUgSUqhH8MKzikvAA

### Arturo

- finished [EuroScipy tutorial](https://github.com/ArturoAmorQ/euscipy_2022) (beta testing/feedback?)
- opened PR on multiclass ROC curve: [#24200](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24200)
    - see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_det.html
- looking for reviewer to grid search PR [#23740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23740)

### Franck

- [Foundations](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/2) of `sklearn_numba_dpex` repo in good direction for merging, with reasonable code standards, ready for future smaller collaborative increments left as TODOs
- [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/11) that caused the docker image used for numba-dpex development to miss the `level_zero` backend
- Encouraging benchmarks on [low performance GPU chipset](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/uhd-graphics.c3811)
- Feedback to intel on various issues [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/886) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/887) [3](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/888) [4](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/891) [5](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/766) [6](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/765) [7](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/764) [8](https://github.com/intel/llvm/issues/6342)

### Vincent

- First scikit-learn based prototype of XGBoost Survival Embeddings (XGBSE), based on RandomForest for now, kicked-off by a pair programming with Olivier. <br> Consists in stacking non-survival-aware RandomForest embedding + Nearest Neighbors or multiple Logistic Regression + unbiased Kaplan Meier survival estimator. [More details](https://loft-br.github.io/xgboost-survival-embeddings/how_xgbse_works.html).
- First notebook to benchmark main models of XGBSE and ours.
- [PR](https://github.com/sebp/scikit-survival/pull/291) on scikit-survival to use Random Survival Forest for our embeddings
- [Introductory stacking multilabel stalled PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24146) is going forward.
- First draft of EuroScipy tutorial (introduction to scipy).


### Loïc

- `out = np.divide(numerator, denominator, where=denominator != 0)` undefined behaviour `out[denominator == 0]` https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24245
- scipy-dev due to pandas changes https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24206
- [float32] marker in commit message. Probably a good idea to use in combination with `all random seeds` in `global_dtype` PRs.
- wip in float32 test failures (Ubuntu atlas and debian 32): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24198

### Olivier

- Reviewed team member work (Survival, GPU K-means, pairwise distances, Loic's fixes...)
- Started reviewing Arturo's ROC example:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24200
- Read / listened to tutorial on sktime to adjust the content of my EuroScipy tutorial:
    - https://www.sktime.org/en/stable/examples/01_forecasting.html
- Off tomorrow afternoon

### Guillaume

- A pass on pending PR in my mailbox
- Round of review on parameter validation
- Find a 10 minutes presentation to do
- Will be on remote Friday

### Discussion

- Onboarding/upgrading of contributions, improve governance document

### TODO/Next

- Focus on preparing EuroScipy (Olivier, Guillaume)
- Finalize ongoing reviews (ROC PR and GPU K-means) (Olivier)
- Continue working on the National AI startegy document (François)
- Iter on ROC PR [#24200](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24200) and cluster metrics PR [#23708](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23708) (Arturo)
- Merging [the foundational PR for Kmeans](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/2) (Franck) followed by:
    - Systematic benchmarking over a large grid of parameters
    - First POC for integration to sklearn as a plugin ?
    - Various incremental improvements left as TODO
    - POC on nvidia GPU using a custom SYCL build with CUDA support
- Sklearn misc. issue & PR review: input validation, float32/64 (Franck)
