### Gael

- Onboarding and strategy with Yann and François
- Teaching yesterday (We are too technical, MOOC + binder heavy, looking forward to pyodide)
- Transition to skrub
- Off next week for two weeks (ICLR + teaching in Rwanda)

### Loïc

- OpenBLAS Pyodide merged https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3331. This gets rid of a number of Pyodide fatal errors.
  + scikit-learn full test suite pass (a few xfailed tests see [conftest.py](https://github.com/lesteve/scikit-learn-tests-pyodide/blob/main/conftest.py)) 
  + scipy full test suite still far from passing, a few fixable signature mismatches, two tests with memory corruption, see (see [conftest.py](https://github.com/lesteve/scipy-tests-pyodide/blob/main/conftest.py). Also plenty of failures most of them in scipy.stats ...
- JupyterLite examples PR ready to be reviewed: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25887
- started thinking a bit more about my JupyterCon talk
- Using Plausible analytics for scikit-learn.org/stable went smoothly https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26160
