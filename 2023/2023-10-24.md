### Jérôme

**skrub**

- adding `SelectCols` and `DropCols` transformer
- fixing scaling of `match_score` in `fuzzy_join` & fixing division by 0 when perfect matches
- fixing codecov reports that were lost after change in CI tests
- fixing similarity encoder inverse transform

**scikit-learn**

- fix 27621 exception in `euclidean_distances` when X is float64 and norm is float32
- start on 27533 column of "remainder" transformer in ColumnTransformer: expose column names rather than indices
- start editing gridsearch user guide to add dropdowns 26617

### Jérémie

- Off last thursday. Off this thursday. Off next monday/tuesday
- callbacks
  - discussions with Guillaume & Loïc -> we can avoid writing on the disk (using managers and queues)
  - requires reimplementing a lot of stuff, but makes everything a lot simpler.
  - allows to work on it more incrementally. I created a feature branch on the repo, will submit first PRs soon, starting with progressbar only.

### Arturo

- iter on recommender system [#sphinx-gallery/pull/1125](https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1125);
- Gael's vulgarization project;
- MOOC general maintenance [#730](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/730), [#731](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/731), [#732](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/732), [#733](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/733), [#735](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/735), [#736](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/736);
