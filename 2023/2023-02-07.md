- CI maintenance: dropping our travis config:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25562 (needs second review)
- A bit more reading on survival analysis and competing risks
    - https://web.stanford.edu/~lutian/coursepdf/unit1.pdf (and other PDFs in the parent solver)

### Loïc

- sphinx-gallery JupyterLite
  + https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/977 has never been closer, still needs a bit of documentation
  + unpin Sphinx in jupyterlite-sphinx: https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite-sphinx/pull/85
