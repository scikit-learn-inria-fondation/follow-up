## October 10th, 2023

    - small docstring fix [#27529](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27529) (merged!);
    - iter on hgbt regression example [#26991](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26991) -> `early_stopping` (see [#27124](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27124));
    - review stuff (`class_of_interest` in `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` [#27291](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27291));
- MOOC
    - general maintenance and rl feedback fixes  [#725](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/725), [#726](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/726), [#727](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/727), [#728](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/728), [#729](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/729);
    - multi-class classification [#730](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/730)

### Olivier

- A bit of literature review for piecewise constant hazard models for survival analysis (still in progress). Added notes to:
    - https://notes.inria.fr/TQRR0EKvThuIstW2uCOgWg
- Some MOOC PRs reviews / merges, did not find time to do write the non-linear feature engineering exercise I have in mind though.
- More work on fast PCA solver:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27491
    - found a non-contiguous memory problem that made `.transform` very slow
      and makes the new solver even more interesting.
    - TODO: address first reviews and split the PR into sub PRs for unrelated fixes / improvements.
- Working on cloudpickle maintenance:
    - review / merged highly requested dataclass fix:
        - https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/513
    - confirmed that anticipated segfault does not happen with Python 3.12 final
    - big code cleanup by removing support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 (and officially adding support for 3.12 on the CI):
        - https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/517
    - TODO:
        - update linter config to ruff
        - use black and pre-commit
        - make a release (probably a major release)
- on site for the rest of the week

### Jérémie

- benchmarked again more carefully against cython 0.29 / 3.0.2 / master for all estimators for which weidentified regressions ((Hist)GBT, KNN, RF) to check if latest change solved the perf regressions and it did.
  PR to bump cython to 3.0.3 for asv benchmarks but I don't see cython 3.0.3 runs (https://scikit-learn.org/scikit-learn-benchmarks/) -> dependency solver fails
- threadpoolctl
  - https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/151
  - https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/152 (deprecated conditional compilation)
- discussed with Guillaume about callbacks and so got back to it

### Guillaume

- Python 3.12: PyPI and conda-forge
- Review PRs for SLEP006
- Triage new issues
- Refactoring `ColumnTransformer`
    - Further improvement that we saw in `TableVectorizer`
- Fun issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/27559
- Wrote proposal for CZI
    - Around evaluation and inspection
- PRs needing review:
    - (Needed for `TunedThresholdClassifier`) add `response_method` in `make_scorer`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26840
    - (Compat arrays/matrices) downcasting indices: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27372
    - (Deprecation pandas-dev) downcasting object columns: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27482
    - Displays improvements by adding `class_of_interest` in DecisionBoundaryDisplay: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27291

### Vincent

Working remotely from the south for 2 weeks to be at a wedding (no holidays).

skrub
- Iterated on [AggJoiner](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/600) (merged) and [DatetimeEncoder PR](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/784)
- Some reviews on the [TableVectorizer PR](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/761) by Guillaume and Jerome
- Onboarding Theo J., very eager to learn

Probabl
- Had a discussion with Camille about questions to ask during user / customer interviews. Need to share this doc.

Teaching
- Corrected TDs from X-HEC (this is so long)

### Franck

- Goal: run kmeans benchmark with clean install and understand performance regression seen on numba_dpex (or dismiss):
    - updated numba_dpex dependencies
        - stability regressions, reported at [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/1152), [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/1156) and [3](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/1157)
        - bisected numba_dpex history
        - solved most issues with help of devs
        - long standing stability issue [906](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/906) also seems fixed !?
    - Related fixes on sklearn_numba_dpex [1](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/118) [2](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/119) [3](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/120) along with some maintenance and cleaning [3](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/117) [4](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/116)
- Opened the PCA benchmark section at sklearn-benchmark-engines, adding to the [initial PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/pull/1)

### Loïc

- back from SED seminar + holidays
- scikit-learn Pyodide CI was merged \o/ https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27346
- Follow-up fixing one of the sparse array test inside Pyodide (merged) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27492

- Finalize CZI call (Guillaume, François)
- Meeting some VCs (Guillaume, François)
- Iterate on hazardous (Vincent)
- Meeting Dataiku on Thursday (Guillaume)
- callbacks (Jérémie)
- investigate asv benchmarks fail (Jérémie)

### Discussion
