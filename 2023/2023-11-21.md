### Franck

- Joblib:
    - `return_as=generator` support for dask [merged](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1520)
    - CI maintenance: version bumps and extension of coverage to some other Pypy versions [merged](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1487)
    - [investigation](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1487#issuecomment-1814215921) for readthedoc pipeline failure ([fixed](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1524) by now)
    - NB: maybe more instability in dask test pipeline ? TODO: add `client.close()` in some dask unit tests.
- Scikit-learn:
    - WIP [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27800) that implements Array API support for Ridge. It's working. No major inconvenience. Soon ready for review.
