### Franck

- Solved 3 epics bugs, reported at [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/865) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/867) [3](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/868) . (frustrating moments :@ )
    - fixes + verion bumps (and Dockerfile update and container publish) in [1](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/82), [2](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/84) 
- Benchmarks [`kmeans_dpcpp`](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/79) and `sklearn_numba_dpex`. On local machine, looking good !
    - `kmeans_dpcpp` gpu ~ `sklearn_numba_dpex` gpu >> `scikit-learn-intelex` >> `scikit-learn`
    - [benchmark PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/75)
- [Enhance and refactor sum kernel](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/79)
- Review going on for sum on axis0 [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/80)
- Browsed TopK code together [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/81) for review with Julien.
    - looks good, but problems in sight on CPU regarding oneapi 2023 compatibility: having errors on bitwise operations...
- Ran our benchmarks on Flex 170 GPU in the devcloud. Disastrous performance so far, trying to understand why. (devcloud being a difficult environment: web interface, lags, timeouts, slow file system, no root access,...)
- Iterating with Tim on the plugin API on the scikit learn side.

### Jérémie

- reviews param validation
- online dict learning with missing values
  - many simplifications in the implementation to reuse as much existing code as possible.
  - clean some deprecations in MiniBatchDictionaryLearning to ease enhancements.
  - small fix of online updates: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25354
  - working on an example: regression on high dim data with many missing values. So far, dict learning useful as imputer but not so much as dimension reducer.

### Arturo

- Was off for holidays for a while
- some forum support for the MOOC
- iter on feature scaling example [#25012](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25012)
- currently looking at [#1514](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1514) (compare Lasso, ElasticNet and ARD)

- a bit of MOOC forum
- a bit of sphinx-gallery Jupyterlite integration without much to show for it yet
- Inria Academy @ CEA meeting. Session starting 2 February with Arturo.

### Vincent

- [Survival analysis] Explored the math of Cardiff's survival method w/ Olivier and derive a simple expression of the survival probability with constant hazard by bins [here](https://notes.inria.fr/TQRR0EKvThuIstW2uCOgWg#).
- [Survival analysis] Implemented the above method. While ranking (C-index) is competitive, the model calibration (Brier score) is poorer than our best models in the [benchmark](https://nbviewer.org/github/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/blob/add_models/notebooks/kkbox_cv_benchmark.ipynb).
- Cython exploration w/ Julien of the v-tab, fused type trick. Also look at inlining. Our revamp of ArgKmin Euclidean specialization is stalled because we have perf decrease and no work-around: [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25170).
- Some reviews of [Meekail's PR](https://github.com/Micky774/scikit-learn/pull/7) for revamping ArgKmin and RadiusNeighbors
- TODO: Review of Adam's [BaseCriterion PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24678)
