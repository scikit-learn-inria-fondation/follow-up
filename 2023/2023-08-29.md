### Olivier

- Reviewed joblib `return_as="unordered_generator"`
    - https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1463
- Reviewed the sphinx-gallery recsys by Arturo
    - https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1125
- Follow-up on blocker issues in upstream Intel libraries for GPU work:
    - https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/358
    - https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex/issues/1416
- Reviewed many PRs related to scipy sparse matrix => array transition:
    - most of the time: just a simple update of the tests and the code works out of the box
    - sometimes a small compat change is required in scikit-learn or even scipy
- Scikit-learn monthly dev meeting:
    - https://hackmd.io/0yokz72CTZSny8y3Re648Q
    - Important discussion on how to communicate / focus maintainers attention import meta-issues that are deemed important for many maintainers
    - Quite a long meeting (see the notes and ask me questions if needed)
- Working on fixing the convergence criterion of lbfgs in LogisticRegression:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27191
- Next:
    - MOOC sprint
    - forgot to do my "retour de mission"
    - on site tomorrow till Friday (but remote Friday morning)
