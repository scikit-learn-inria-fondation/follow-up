## September 26th, 2023

### Arturo

- MOOC
    - InvalidParameterError in `plot_tree` [#720](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/720) (fixed in 1.3.1);
    - expand contents on `predict_proba` [#722](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/722);
    - reviewed `predict_proba` PRs by Guillaume [#710](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/710) and [#711](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/711)
    - meeting MOOC (November 8th!);
- scikit-learn
    - reviews/merges Guillaume's PRs to fix warnings in the doc;
- TODO : Inria Chile

### Olivier

- MOOC: following up on Arturo's reviews (still WIP)
    - Launch date is November 8th but we need to be ready before to give
      time to the Inria Learning Lab team to reflect our changes to the FUN
      MOOC instance.
- Reviewed PCA for sparse inputs with implicit centering via a custom
  LinearOperator
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18689
  - works fine with the scipy.sparse "arpack" solver
  - does not work (assertion failures with big rtol) with our "randomized" solver but I don't understand why
  - plan to finalize the PR for the "arpack" solver first and maybe extend to the "randomized" solver in a follow-up PR
- Addressed review comments on the PR that refactors/fixes the failing neighbors tests:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27281
- Continue effort to review PRs related to scipy sparse arrays and Array API:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27438
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27381 (Array API for LabelEncoder) => need to follow-up
- Attempted fix to incomplete testing of Array API support for PCA:
    - lacked some hyper-parameter combinations
    - discovered missing feature in Array API
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27431
    - PR is still draft as a result
    - probably need to xfail explicitly some cases in the meantime
- Next:
    - Review in priority issues targeted for 1.4 or identified as priorities by other maintainers.
    - Finalize linear module refactoring for the MOOC (one exercise to refactor)

### Jérémie

- assisted Guillaume a bit for the release
- profiling cython 3 regressions. Unsuccessful, wasting too much time...
- threadpoolctl: bug when 2 libraries have a common prefix (e.g. libblis, libbliss). I have some ideas but nothing will be foolproof.

### Loïc

- run scikit-learn test suite inside Pyodide ready to review: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27346
  + one xfailed test left for a later fix: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/27470
- Python 3.12 wheel ready for review https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27027
- Pyodide: updated scipy to 1.11.2 and scikit-learn 1.3.1. Part of Pyodide 0.24.1 released yesterday.
- giving Dask tutorial tomorrow https://calcul.math.cnrs.fr/2023-09-atelier-dask.html

### Guillaume

- Release 1.3.1
- Try to remove deprecation-like warning from the examples in the doc
    - We probably need to backport those PRs for a clean stable rendering
- Worked on reviewing Adrin/Stefanie SLEP006 PRs
- Need reviews:
    - add permalink to details summary: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27409
    - downcasting dtype for DIA -> CSR/COO: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27372
    - First improvement for the `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27291

### Jérôme 

- InterpolationJoin, addressing 2nd round of reviews
- smaller skrub issues -- ci testing installed package, datetimeencoder bugs
- TODO:
  - adding polars support for InterpolationJoin
  - updating Joiner with decisions from last skrub meeting
  - sessionize transformer?

### François

- FDDay: Networking event and Yann's annoucement
- Design and discussions about our future offices

### Vincent

P16
- Met Nicolas and Fabien at Cannes and Sophia-Antipolis
- Discussed Professional services and knowledge graphs.
- Onboarding Camille on data science and MLOps

Skrub
- Iterated on [`AggJoiner`](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/600) and [`InterpolateJoiner`](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/pull/742) w/ Jerome
