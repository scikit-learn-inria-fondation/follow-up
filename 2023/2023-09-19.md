### Guillaume

- Release 1.3.1:
    - Branching: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27406
    - Double checking for Cython min-deps and upper-bound pinning for NumPy 2.0
    - Sphinx warning due to dropdown: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27409
    - Generator for authors: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27403
- Clipping effect due to subsampling in `QuantileTransformer`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27374
- Cont'd review on sparse arrays
    - conversion from DIA to CSR/COO/BSR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27372

### Olivier

- Refactored the way we test neighbors results, while dealing with 
  admissible result swaps caused by rounding errors at a given tolerance
  and also making the error message more explicit in case of failure.
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27281
- Reviewing issues/PRs mentionned at last week's meeting
- Also working on follow-up to Arturo reviews on my MOOC PRs
- Speed some effort investigating what was slow on our CI:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27383 (slow tests)
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27382 (slow conda install)
- on site tomorrow till Friday
- Next:
    - review blocking problems for 1.3.1
    - more mooc
    - review engine benchmarking
    - review array api PRs
    - review Christian's work on fixing the convergence criterion of linear regression solvers

### Jérémie

- profiling cython 3 regressions. Give up :(
- off yesterday
- reviews for 1.3.1
- bump to cython 3 in benchmarks https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27419

### Loïc

- scikit-learn maintenance:
  + Use `.toarray` instead of deprecated `.A` for sparse arrays (merged) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27367
  + Python 3.12 wheel testing still ongoing https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27027. numpy 1.26 release should make this a bit easier.
- Pyodide inside scikit-learn
  + draft PR to run tests inside Pyodide making progress: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27346
  + some recent failures with sparse arrays inside Pyodide. Combination of Pyodide being 32bit, a change in scipy 1.11 with sparse arrays with 64 bit indices and sparse arrays tests being added in
    scikit-learn, need spend a bit more time to understand how to fix it without too much pain
  + Update JupyterLite button to Pyodide 0.24 (meaning scikit-learn 1.3.0 inside JupyterLite) (merged) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27405
- Inria Academy session yesterday with Arturo

### Franck

- Almost done writing all features for the benchmark repository [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/pull/1)
    - lots of cool features ! [preview of readme](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/blob/945ecd2d4b8ce9803a0ea9eb9758cbc5f16c9ea7/README.md) and [preview of google worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1te_3jY6vI4wo3-V7xbmWQai5Mdh5plWdLst2ox0wuLM/edit?userstoinvite=olivier.grisel@gmail.com&sharingaction=manageaccess&role=writer#gid=1392436075)
    - Remainings TODOs: 
        -  add a few tools to maintain the list of GPUs in the results
        -  run all benchmarks and consolidate the database of results
- Got a feedback for triton compiling issues that should unblock the trials [discussion](https://github.com/intel/intel-xpu-backend-for-triton/issues/90)

### Jérôme 

- [interpolation join](https://gitlab.inria.fr/jerome.dockes/skrub_scratch) in polars and pandas, now adding doc & examples before opening PR
- more reading skrub code & aggjoiner PR

### TODO

- Mooc meeting on thursday morning (Arturo)
- Mooc reviews and possibly more PRs (Arturo, Olivier)
- scikit-learn 1.3.1 release (Guillaume, Jeremie, Olivier)
