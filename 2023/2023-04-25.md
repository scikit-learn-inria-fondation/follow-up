### Olivier

- numerical study of the 2 different ways to handle the intercept in ridge/OLS:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25948#issuecomment-1517587995
    - what we do in scikit-learn (fitting on centered data and computing the intercept a posteriori instead adding a column of 1.) is best, both for low alpha and high alpha values
    - still need to update all the ridge tests accordingly.
- work in progress on for the jupytercon tutorial on survival:
    - https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/pull/6
    - tweaked the data generating process to make it possible for the conditional surival models (Cox PH, Survival Forest, our own GradientBoostingCIF) to significantly beat the unconditional estimator (Kaplan Meier).
    - still a lot to do: clean up the way we add censoring to the ground truth
    - actually implement and evaluate the conditional competing risks models
    - adapt my duckdb/ibis code to demo it on synthetic truck data and turn it into an exercise
    - discovered a new paper / library and benchmark dataset for competing risks
        - https://github.com/RyanWangZf/SurvTRACE/
        - https://seer.cancer.gov/data/ competing risk modeling: cardio vascular induced-deaths vs cancer deaths
        - but we cannot use the data for teaching because data re-distribution is forbidden. access is granted automatically (even for statistical software developers) but only if you go through a form. Still a very interesting dataset for research and method benchmarking.
- Follow-up on PolynomialFeatures dtype for high dim sparse data: investigating a problem with clang on 32 bit linux:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23731
- Started to review support for collapsing infrequent categories in HGBDT:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26268
- TODO:
    - follow-up on RNG/clone design discussion
    - follow-up on SLEP6 related PRs
    - more jupytercon tutorial
    - late JMLR software track review
    - submit abstract for survival analysis euroscipy
