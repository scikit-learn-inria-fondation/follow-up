### Gael

- Done: reposition Vincent a bit away from APHP
- Ramping up with Yann
- Next: away most of this week (conference "IDA") and teaching next Monday

### Olivier

- SLEP 6 drafting meeting:
    - https://hackmd.io/LODWgwO_Shu7QaSRa7cDKw?6-April-2023
    - TODO: review https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26103
- Change default number of threads for OpenMP to number of physical cores
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26082
- Spotted regressions in benchmark
- Tried to craft a reproducer for the duckdb-jupyter memory errors
    - but I cannot reproduce the problem on the developer branch of duckdb
- Reviewed work by Vincent on the first part of the jupytercon tutorial on survival analysis
    - TODO: start to work on the second part in parallel, in particular dataprocessing from implicit failure data
- TODO:
    - review Arturo's PR
    - follow-up on linear regression solvers

### Loïc

- Pyodide:
  + OpenBLAS PR after some cleanup is ready for review \o/ https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3331. This will fix some of the Pyodide fatal errors we were seeing with CLAPACK, also more maintainable. If you really want to know the determinant of complex matrices equal to zero was an OpenBLAS bug in 0.29.32 (fixed in 0.29.33) not related at all to emscripten e.g. https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/18208.
  + skipping scipy problematic tests (fatal errors) or marking them as xfailed in conftest.py https://github.com/lesteve/scipy-tests-pyodide/pull/25/files
  + waiting for OpenML to add the necessary headers for fetch_openml to work in JupyterLite (CORS issue)
- joblib
  + review Dask backend doc update https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1411
  + use flake8 rather than flake8_diff.sh https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1415  

### François

- Was off last week
- Preparation of the next P16 steps

### Jérémie

- More flexible constraint for validation of missing values markers (numeric vs generic markers)
- Some progress on matrix factorization with missing values
  - Implementation of IterativeSVD with a transform.
    issue: not penalized
  - Implementation of SoftImpute with a transform.
    This one is penalized (nuclear norm). Very close to MMMF but with a convex loss.
  - Experiment impute-then-classify on a high dimensional dataset. IterativeImputer can't even complete 1 iteration on this dataset.
- ready for merge: cython lint https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25861
- ready for merge: quick reviews
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26025
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26016

### Arturo

- Iter on recommender system to sphinx-gallery [#1125](https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1125) (with Guillaume)
- experiments on outlier detection example [#25878](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25878) (outliers in Ames housing instead of breast cancer)
- experiments on LOF using nmslib (no PR yet)
- discussion: what to propose as talk to FUN conference?


### Guillaume

- Triage and SLEP006 meeting
- Meeting with Adrin and Maren regarding scheduling interviews for the diversity internship
- Review of the Arturo's recommender system for sphinx-gallery
- Revamp `CutOffClassifier`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26120
    - I would need a second review on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26037
- Try to profile memory and time regression reported by Olivier
- Review linked to parameter validation:
    - validation parameter
    - refactoring of `GraphicalLasso`

### Franck

- Got SSH access to bare metal PVC GPU for the week
    - managed to debug and get decent performance for KMeans on PVC, and reported the ins and outs of the performance analysis to Sasha and Dipto
    - good performance showings of top-k generalizes to PVC
    - matmul performance bad on PVC
- Would appreciate help on understanding performance perks of the matmul ! [call to help](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/984)
- Reported and help further debug caching issues on `dpctl`/`numba_dpex` [PR](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/pull/9465)
- KNN: last steps is sticking pieces together to assemble KNN POC.
    - currently working on multi-row top-k
- Array API: 
    - independent work from Thomas tends to confirm our suggestions for generalizing Array API support on `check_array` [discussion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25433#issuecomment-1497939200)
- Proposition "testimonials and demo" de Jay
- Our dockerfile is broken

### Vincent

- Survival demo notebook for JupyterCon w/ Olivier
- Continue ramp-up on skabular
- APHP greenlight to use polars for data scientists
- Use yesterday free monday to work on the fundamentals with *Probabilistic ML* book of Kevin Murphy
