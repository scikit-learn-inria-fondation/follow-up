### Olivier

hazardous:
- reviewed theoretical work by Julie: there is still a bias in our `GradientBoostingIncidence` and it's possible to visualize it experimentally.
- Next: pair-prog to implement the unbiased weighting (which should be even simpler than what we do)

MOOC:
- Last PR reviews (everything is ready now?)
- Tediously fixed the github actions workflows that generates the jupyter book preview websites in PRs
- Experimented with `(Spline || OneHot) + Nystroem(kernel="poly", degree=2, n_components=300) + RidgeClassifierCV / LogisticRegressionCV` and profiled with py-spy:
    - `RidgeClassifierCV` is 5x to 10x faster than equivalent LRCV (depending on coarseness of the regularization grid),
    - both models yield similar test accuracy on Adult Census,
    - `RidgeClassifierCV` is really fast but still the slowest step of this pipeline, followed by Nystroem
    - spline CPU overhead can be ignored,

scikit-learn
- Read about the GIL plan for CPython:
    - https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython-acceptance/37075
- Started to review DF-related PRs by Thomas (WIP):
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27315
- TODO: review `TunedThresholdClassifier`

### Franck

- sick ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·
- A bit more cleaning / formatting to sklearn-engine-benchmarks [repo](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/) / [result sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1te_3jY6vI4wo3-V7xbmWQai5Mdh5plWdLst2ox0wuLM/)
- Lost access to intel idc with max series gpus
- Managed to build torch+ipex from source. No success with triton extension yet.
- Investigated scikit-learn kmeans++
    - profiling show _euclidean_distance is the (massive) bottleneck
    - investigating replacement using cython pairwise distance, extending existing [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26983)
    - expected 10x speedup

### JÃ©rÃ´me

**skrub**

- `SelectCols` & `DropCols` PR merged
- continued `fuzzy_join` & `Joiner` PRs (fix `match_score` scaling & new Joiner interface)

**scikit-learn**

- ColumnTransformer remainder columns dtype PR: limiting warnings, adressing review
- ColumnTransformer and pd.NA: tried to find a workaround but in the end we will raise when no transform="pandas" and transformer output contains pd.NA
- finished dropdowns in grisearch user guide
