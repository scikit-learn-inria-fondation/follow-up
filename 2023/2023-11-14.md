### Gael

- A bit of deontologie

### Franck

- Joblib contributions:
    - add `return_as=generator/generator_unordered` for `dask` backend [PR](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1520)
    - The PR also features overhaul of codecov pipeline
    - Opened similar [PR](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/41028) at Ray 
        - NB: we could apply the change at joblib level in the meantime ?
- discussion about kmeans++ in sklearn:
    - with jdudboisb and jjerphan
    - pairwise-distance implementation in cython in float32 do have the upcasting trick
    - but pairwise distance performance without reduction is underwhelming
    - would need a fast pairwise-distance only function in sklearn
    - NB: for kmeans++, the issue mostly arise in float32 because of the upcasting hack, it's fine with float64 (3-5x faster)
- Currently working on adding Array API support to Ridge.

### Olivier

    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27491
- Array API reviews:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27736

    - meeting with Learning Lab next Monday (20th Nov);
    - so far running smooth !

### Loïc

at Turing (again!) Thursday and Friday after Inria Academy session

**1password**
- open-source free plan approved \o/
- sent invitations to the ones that asked. Created shared bot accounts "vault"
- limitation you can not create custom group (business plan only and we have
  the team plan) so all owners will have access to everything (risky
  security-wise?) or add people one by one

**Pyodide**
- more debug of JSPI-related fatal errors https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/4249
- skip problematic tests for now in lesteve/scipy-tests-pyodide: https://github.com/lesteve/scipy-tests-pyodide/pull/30
- feed-back on scipy using meson https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/4276

**scikit-learn**
- first cron job for lock-file bot worked \o/
- fixed the lint workflow concurrency bug (merged) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27773
- encoding issue with HTML repr (merged): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27731
- helping a Statify team member to get started to contribute on copy=False preprocessing doc (not that trivial) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27691
  
Jean-Zay users committee last week

### François

**Probabl**
- Raising funds (meeting VC, Corporate Ventures, French Public Bank)
- Ethical files
- Draft board

**Consortium**
- Met sktime
- Accounting iteration - every figures are gathered, we now need to merge the different works
- Organizing the TC
