### TODO retrospective

- [ ] test and debug recommender system (Arturo)
- [ ] Point towards HGBDT from RF [#26220](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26220) (Arturo)
- [ ] SLEP006 follow-up (Guillaume)
- [ ] Make EuroSciPy proposal (Guillaume)
- [ ] Advertise EuroScipy Cfp + un des tuto d'intro (feel free to submit a tuto on more specific topics)+ sprint (François)
- [ ] follow-up on RNG/clone design discussion (Olivier)
- [ ] follow-up on SLEP6 related PRs (Olivier)
- [x] jupytercon tutorial (Olivier)
- [ ] submit abstract for survival analysis euroscipy (Olivier)

### Olivier

- A lot of progress on our jupytercon tutorial on survival and competing risks analysis with Vincent.
    - Fixed a bug introduced by tied time-to-event synthetic dataset that was introducing a significant bias in our competing risk data: solution was to randomly jitter the duration columns below the original day-level time resolution.
    - Now observe perfect fit between Kaplan-Meier and Aalen-Johansen estimates and the theoretical survival and event-specific cumulative incidence curves derived from the hazard functions of the data-generating process.
    - Improved part 1 of the tutorial:
        - Linear Cox PH model is a good baseline
        - RSF is almost as good but too slow
        - Gradient Boosting CIF is better than either and quite fast
        - Polynomial Cox PH is even slightly better (as an exercise):
            - spline transform of numerical values + nystroem approximation of degree 2 kernel to model feature interactions
        - Both are quite close to the optimum test-set performance measured on the theoretical curves derived from our knowledge of the data generating process.
    - Still need to finalize the competing risks part of part 1.

### Arturo

- Compare HGBDT with RF example [#26220](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26220);
- euroscipy proposal / pay jupytercon;
- waiting for review on permutation importance example [#26221](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26221);
- reviews on gradio sprint's [selected examples](https://notes.inria.fr/aZ2vLFvyRBmrTF9PUA4odg#);
- TODO [stlite](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/new-library-stlite-a-port-of-streamlit-to-wasm-powered-by-pyodide/25556/28)?

### Yann (P16)

- New Mattermost team for P16, proper channels
- Brainstorming started on branding alignment
- Shared P16 structure template with key people in gov, inria, consortium
- Product brainstorming session with François, Jean-Michel & Vincent
- Attended DeepGreen kick-off session
- Started Communication channel & todo board, start preparing for P16 kick-off event
- Initial meeting with Joost & Marie-Helene for EU funding

### Franck

- Started writing testimonial draft for intel [notes.inria.fr](https://notes.inria.fr/bseNOr81RpiXyt7ZMLkaVg#)
- Submitted [euroscipy proposal](https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/review/N79JHVFARJHMR7MVTZGYAGK7HJLJ3V9D)
- Investigated the weekly docker build pipeline
    - can't be fixed until [upstream package upload issue](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1190) is fixed
- Implemented buffer reuse for TopK [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/110)
- Implemented KNN POC [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/111) on top of matmul+KNN
    - performances disappointing
    - TopK histogram step is the main bottleneck
    - From litterature, could be optimized up to 5x, not more
- NB: investigation helped find bottleneck in `dirty-cat` coming from sparse KNN, is it normal ?
- Submitted QOL suggestion in dpctl [issue](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1192)


### Guillaume

- `CutOffClassifier`: post-tuning the decision threshold for making "hard" predictions: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26120
    - Write an example to motivate the use of the tuner
    - Solve a couple of bugs
- Got back in trying updating `pytest`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26184
    - New issue with some Rust/Cargo issue
- Interview for diversity internship NumFocus
- Meeting EuroSciPy Tuesday
