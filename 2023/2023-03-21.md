- [ ] missing values in partial dependence (Guillaume)
- [x] Int/Real constraint (Guillaume)
- [ ] Come back to `.cv_results()` plots
- [x] continue work on cython-lint (Jérémie)

### Gael

- Taught my first course at EHESS
    - Binder was broken on the MOOC :)
    - Actually found dirty-cat useful :)
- Presented dirty-cat to Afpy
- Thomas will come by early June
- Preparing questions for funding agency...

### Julien

- Mainly have been reviewing Pull Requests
- [MAINT Group all sorting utilities in `sklearn.utils._sorting`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25606)
    - which does compile on my machine but not on the CI anymore?
- Participated to discussions for the Governance:
    - agreed to close and closed [SLEP019: Governance Update - Recognizing Contributions Beyond Code (version II)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/81)
    - approved [GOV introduce rights for groups as discussed in SLEP019](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25670/)
- Questions:
    - [Omar Salman looks like a recurring contributor](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3AOmarManzoor+). WDYT?
    - Does this PR have value: [ENH add float32 support in BallTree and KDTree](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25914)?
    - Does writing about the design of `PairwiseDistancesReductions` have value?

### Arturo

- Was off on Friday afternoon and Monday morning;
- rework outlier detection example [#25878](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25878);
- discussion with Olivier and first experiments on `StandardScaler` parameter `shared_mean_and_scale` (discussion [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25334#issuecomment-1470450090));
- working on recommender system to sphinx-gallery [#1081](https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/1081).

### Olivier

- CI fixes (early cancellation on Azure) and reviews (test speed and coverage)
- Second pass of live review of Arturo's work on improving the outlier detection tutorial example
- Final review and merge of Target Encoder
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25334
    - TODO: follow-up work: add `shared_mean_and_scale=False` to `*Scaler`
- Deep thinking about whats wrong in the `ols_ridge_dataset` test fixture when `n_features > n_samples` and `fit_intercept=True` and how to fix it.
    - Follow-up:
        - Fix: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22947
        - Fix: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22855
        - Improve the documentation about minimum norm solution to the OLS problem
        - Make cholesky fallback on lsqr instead of svd in case of near singular `X.T @ X + alpha I`
    - Question: is the parametrization `intercept_ = y_mean - coef_.T X_mean` always valid for ridge regression when `n_samples > n_features` and `alpha > 0`?

### Jérémie

- Speed-up the test runs on CI.
   - speed-up a few individual tests (there are still several (too) long tests)
   - Better setup for xdist: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25918
- reviewed Guillaume's get_response PR, I just need to do a final pass
- review global_random_seed PRs
  - maybe a bug in Mixture: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24616
  - Should graphical_lasso really stop on ``dual_gap < tol`` ? is it guaranteed to deacrease toward 0 ? I suspect it can decrease toward a >0 value
- needs feedback (avoid nested param validation) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25815
- more work to do with cython linting to make it more usability more friendly

### Franck

- Working on implementing an efficient `matmul` kernel, inspired by [this tutorial](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM)
    - confirmed that compiler unroll loops (sometimes)
    - figured issues with use of `break` in `numba_dpex`
    - managed to reach CPU performance on iGPU2
    - looking for 3* speedup remaining improvemenmt to reach near-dpnp (blas) performance
- Preliminary read of `kmeans_dpcpp` project that instructs on combined use of SYCL and pybind11.

### Loïc

- Jupyterlite sphinx-gallery integration
  + draft PR on using JupyterLite in scikit-learn examples:     https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25887, with [browsable output](http://lesteve.github.io/scikit-learn) (CircleCI limitation with JupyterLite starting a WebWorker). The main question is how to manage user expectations. Ideas: using a button with Beta near to it, adding a markdown cell at the beginning of the notebook saying this is    experimental. Other ideas?
  + Fix target URL of JupyterLite button https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1105
  + Changes following jupyterlite-sphinx 0.8 release https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1107 https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1106
- Pyodide
  + Fix regression due to numpy 1.24 f2py changes: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3658
  + Updated scikit-learn to 1.2.2 in Pyodide: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3654
- scikit-learn
  + switching to Scientific Python Plausible instance for analytics:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25547. Added the item to the developer meetup.
  + started to think about building the scikit-learn wheel with emcripten in a CI build
- MOOC modify Binder links to open full-index.ipynb: https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/692

Next: being able to modify notebook based on content in sphinx-gallery. Useful for:
- adding %pip install seaborn when needed
- patching HTTP calls with pyodide-http when needed
  ```py
  %pip install pyodide-http
  
  import pyodide_http
  pyodide_http.patch_all()`
  ```
- adding a markown cell with experimental warnings
- possibly switching the matplotlib notebook backend when needed (more useful  for matplotlib gallery than scikit-learn)
  
### Guillaume

- Review couple of PRs that was in my list
- Needing review:
    - `ValidationCurveDisplay` [#25120](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25120)
    - `_get_response_value` [#23073](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23073)
    - example regarding multiclass [#25228](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25228)
- Ongoing:
    - Plotting uncertainties in `Display`: `.from_cv_results` (PR not open yet) and Wilk's method [#25856](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25856). Needed to think about the API.
    - Trying to get back Codecov to speak [#25919](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25919)


### Vincent

- [Survival Analysis] Creating a synthetic dataset with 3 types of events for JupyterCon
- [SKITS] [Working demo](https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/blob/main/demo_mlflow.py) of MLFlow on Onyxia for survival model.
    => Quick draft note for [MLFlow](https://www.notion.so/vincentmaladiere/MLFlow-quick-guide-55e6227e4bef40978735ba810b390520) and how we could leverage it with SKITS.
    => Reflexion about our MVP w/ Guillaume & François.
- Start to benchmark polars to compare it against DuckDB
- Reading materials from dirty-cat and pointers by Gaël
