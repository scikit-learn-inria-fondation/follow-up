- release dirty-cat 0.4. So cool!!! Fuzzy join, deduplication, FeatureAugmenter, entity embeddings
- Next:
    - meeting with Bruno Sportisse on economical strategy
    - vacations

### Julien

- Off this week
- Joblib sprint:
  - answered/closed a few issues with Olivier
  - [Experiments](https://gist.github.com/jjerphan/271caa16411f2e55a8aea1a4f6dcdeca):
      - compared workloads dispatch using `joblib.Parallel(backend="threading")` vs `OpenMP`
  - spent some time understanding how one could serialize dynamically-defined `cpdef` functions via cloudpickle 
  - opened a few PRs:
     - [MAINT Explicit support for Python 3.11](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1389)
     - [MAINT Simplify warning in `_persist_input`](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1390)
     - [DEV Add issues' templates](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1399)
- Guided Vincent to some resources on OO design and programming with C++

### Franck

- participation to joblib sprint
    - joblib `return_generator` feature is happening ! last round of review being currently done. NB: PR has moved from [588](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/588) to [1393](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1393)
- `sklearn_numba_dpex`:
    - Ran a new round of benchmarks for `sklearn_numba_dpex` on intel edge cloud. Confirms previously communicated results. Parameters `sub_group_size` and the auto-`global_mem_cache_size` do not affect the performance.
    - Severine Haubert team ran the new benchmark script with CLI. Now reports expected performance for Flex170 and A750 !
    - Prepared bump to `numba_dpex==0.20.0dev3` [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/93)
    - Nb: previous PR and cleaning PR both blocked by blocker issue in `numba_dpex`
- `numba_dpex`
    - new developer joined the pool. Worked on caching performance following our feedbacks, using our kmeans to measure the progress ! [PR](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/pull/912)
    - The [blocker issue](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/906) is not yet addressed. Contacted Deb Diptorup directly for information on priority.
- Scheduling meeting with HAS:
    - Mathieu Doutreligne contacted me for a talk at HAS on my work at sancare -> scheduled March 14
- Next TODO:
    - profiling session with Oleksander
    - There's been [talks](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25535#discussion_r1107152464) on the plugin API on the sklearn side + related [talks](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25617) on the Array API in sklearn, I should participate
    - use compiler option to test loop unrolling for `sklearn_numba_dpex` kernels
    - finish joblib PR

### Arturo

- MOOC maintenance [#688](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/688), [#689](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/689);
- iter on [#25429](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25429) and [#25559](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25559);
- some reviews [#25350](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25350), [#25602](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25602), [#25608](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25608);
- opened issue on sphinx gallery to suggest "recommendation system";
- discussions with Vincent on `parallel_backend` example with context manager using different backends.

### Olivier

- Fixed a problem for the handling of affinity constraints on loky for linux/PyPy and maybe also windows:
    - https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/381
    - Unfortunately this does not fix the slow running (deadlocked?) tests when removing the LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT from the PyPy build on the loky CI...
- Avoid spurious messages at loky shutdow by early cleanup of release executor manager threads:
    - https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/383
- Reviewing and adding a test for `loky.freeze_support`:
    - https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/375 (still wip with a segfault when runnning the pyinstaller test from within tox...)

TODO:
- review remaining joblib PRs from the sprint.
- continue review for target encoder (at least I read the 2 papers mentionned as reference...)


### Jérémie

- sprint joblib
  - [joblib] context manager like parallel_backend but allows to set all args passed to the configure method of the backends.
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1392
  - [joblib] clean deprecations (should have been removed in 0.16)
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1397
  - [threadpoolctl] CI: whitelist test_multiple_openblas for the check that no test is always skipped
    https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/133
- WIP workaround deprecation of cython conditional compilation (that we use for openmp)
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25654
