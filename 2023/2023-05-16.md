### Gael

- Went by jupytercon, discuss technological stacks and business models
- moving dirty-cat to skrub


### Franck

- Intel testimonial:
    - dismissed idea of showing implementations of matmul/topk/knn with `numba_dpex` because of too poor performances
    - will focus on `KMeans`
- Investigated use of [Intel extension for pytorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch)
    - ease of installation: similar to `numba_dpex` (using conda/pip)
    - slightly better performance than `dpnp` for comparable primitives
    - benefits from all required `torch` primitives for TopK: `matmul`, `cdist`, `topk`,... with optimized performance 
        - xpu `torch.topk` is slow in latest release but fixed on master [issue](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/345)
    - Flex and Max support, experimental Arc support, works partially on iGPU [issue](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/339)
    - responsive dev team
    - hype !!
- => need to reevaluate roadmap and maybe reconsider priority of plugin approach

### Olivier

- jupytercon tutorial on survival analysis:
    - https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark#notebooks
    - submitted a shorter version to euroscipy 2023
    - understood the impact of the train-time monotonicity constraint that causes overestimation bias of the cumulative incidence for the largest time horizon. This bias is stronger when the model is overfitting.
    - removing the train time monotonicity constraints yields consistent models: as sample size increases the average estimated CIF converges to the Aalean Johansen estimate which is itself in line with the theoretical CIF.
    - The performance metrics of the unconstrained model are better (and very good for large training sets)
    - adding a predict time "monotonic-smoother" based on isotonic regression leads to some bias but apparently lower than with the train-time monotonicity constraints.
    - monotonicity constraints (fit time, predict time or None) will be exposed as a user settable hyper-param in our new `hazardous` repo to make this model pip installable.
- MOOC meeting:
    - will move to a self-paced model, targetting October for the new version
    - some fixes to do based on experience teaching it live at the University
- catching up with emails and github discussions.
- TODO:
    - sync up with Franck for the future of the COE developments
    - follow-up on Arturo's PR.

### Arturo

- JupyterCon 2023
- meeting MOOC session 3
- working on slides for FUN conference
- got asked to organize sprint at EuroPython
- sprint MOOC ?

### Jérémie

- tried to fix the asv benchmarks.
  - daily run now enabled again
  - but the runs fail. Seems related to conda not finding the env created by asv
- mf + missing values for impute then regress
  - unexpected? behavior with make_regression and linear model
  - thoughts about new meta estimator for imputers and CV ?

### Loïc

- JupyterCon scikit-learn MOOC presentation http://lesteve.github.io/talks/2023-scikit-learn-mooc-jupytercon/
- Build Pyodide wheel in scikit-learn CI: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26374
- get back to scikit-image JupyterLite examples: https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/6911
- quick investigation about supporting meson in Pyodide for scikit-image, seems easier than for scipy but still some issues (see https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3649#issuecomment-1469002674)
- submitted talk to EuroScipy about Pyodide/JupyterLite work
- MOOC session 3 wrap-up meeting

### Vincent

- Was off
- [JupyterCon] Presented survival analysis at JupyterCon, met engineers from Coiled (dask) but was a bit jetlaged
