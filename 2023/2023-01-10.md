### Julien

 - Approved the first draft of [SLEP 020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/84) by Thomas that comes before [SLEP 019](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/74)
 - Started writing [yet-undocumented Cython Tips](https://hackmd.io/FR4Vp_OgR-WhlVEsVZzsIw)
 - Reviewed Cython PRs

     - Vincent's PR i.e. [ENH Euclidean specialization of `DatasetsPair` instead of `ArgKmin` and `RadiusNeighbors`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25170)
     - others' for warnings removals and maintenance
 - Started reviewing:
     - [MNT Refactor tree to share splitters between dense and sparse data](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25306/files)
         - smart types' polymorphism à la 
     - [1d radix topk and application to cluster relocation in kmeans](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/81/files)
 - Added a development release segment in Cython public version identifier
 - Opened the following PR:
     - [FIX Make `cd_fast` use `cnp.ndarray` to support readonly buffers](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25172)
     - [FIX `const`-qualify `BaseSparseSplitter` attributes of CSR or CSC data](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25341)

     - [CI Handle Circle CI REST API response](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25340)

Follow-up:
- Olivier and Guillaume, this PR might is mergeable IMO:
    - [TST use global_dtype in sklearn/manifold/tests/test_t_sne.py](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22675)
- Decision: close this PR with an explanation.

### Jérémie

- working on MiniBatchDictionaryLearning with missing values.
  - first implementation ok-ish
  - bottleneck is the sparse coding (need to encode one sample at a time)
  - need to deal with triple validation
  - having hard time to get equivalence when fully observable
  - Does anyone have an idea of a good example for that ?

### Vincent

- Survival bench: clean [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/blob/add_models/notebooks/kkbox_cv_benchmark.ipynb), added PyCox DeepHit benchmark and individual survival probabilities plot
Next: use K-means on survival probabilities curve to create user groups
- [Nice Cython v-table trick](https://gist.github.com/Micky774/d5c7ecbde3cbb90a7b05d5a680bb2bd0) and inlining to try to improve decreased performance for Euclidean ArgKmin and RadiusNeighbors [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25170).

	+ includes application to cluster relocation in kmeans where it replaces dpnp.partition
	+ next steps:
		* design an approach for application to KNN
		* optimize with "Dr. TopK" optimizations
- Cleaning of 2D sum kernel over axis 1 [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/79)
- Implementation of 2D sum kernel over axis 0 [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/80) (useful for top k)
- Rather slow feedback on [intel-compute-runtime bug](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/issues/588)
- Bunch of remaining compatibility issues with recent dependencies bumps (oneapi 2023, numba-dpex 0.19.0,...), various issues opened in relevant repos, finishing investigations is next in todo list [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1023) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1022) [3](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/850)
- Access to one real GPU on intel edge cloud, working to install our benchmark on the node.
- Meeting with Vladimir Kostarev, several improvements in line:
	+ access to better GPUs
	+ getting in touch with people at intel experimenting with ML with intel GPU, can also share packaging concerns there
- Mail from Jay: asks for paper submission roadmap ??
- Got an access token to intel customer support pipeline
- Other things on roadmap:
	+ pending discussion on input management in `sklearn-numba-dpex` [thread](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/74)
	+ implementing the roadmap in sklearn wip-engines branch [hackmd roadmap](https://hackmd.io/--MJTgQzSFSYaaAgcJWQZg?edit)
	+ benchmark new version of Sasha's `kmeans_dpcpp`
	+ continuing joblib `return_generator` (hard)
