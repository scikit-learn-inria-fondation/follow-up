### Olivier

- Peer-analysis of Arturo's draft on the use of `OrdinalEncoder` with `max_categories` in tree-based outlier detection + tuning of LOF `n_neighbors`.
- Review of progress by Vincent on survival and started to think about the content of our jupytercon tutorial.
- Added new test to the Target Encoder PR to highlight a simple case where empirical Bayes shrinkage is not engough and nested CV is required:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25334
- Investigated convergence speed and numerical stability of different solvers for `LinearRegression`:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22855
- Related, better understanding of what causes lack of convergence to the minimum norm solution for Ridge with alpha -> 0.
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/22947
    - Christian already knew the solution (I just did not read it...) but I am confirmed his intuition with experiments. I think we can adapt the test to check for convergence to the minimum norm-of-coef solution instead of  minimum norm-of-coef+intercept solution when `fit_intercept=True`. Needs more work to check that this is 100% accurate for all solvers.

### Julien

  - After rediscussion during the Drafting meeting:
    - Rework [FEA Introduce `PairwiseDistances`, a generic back-end for `pairwise_distances`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25561):
        - open a PR for the feature branch with TODO list for subsequent PRs
        - support the previous implementation of `sparse_manhattan`
        - rerun benchmark on more configuration (sparse-dense, n_test, n_train)
