### Gael

- Meeting with Inria on the future for the foundation
    - Welcome Selma
- Half-written blog post on the importance of scikit-learn
- Renewing the contracts of the people who need to be renewed

### Loïc

- closer look at Leo's benchmark: for now I do not plan to rerun the full benchmarks but try to look at a couple of datasets (road-safety and taxy-green-dec) where either xgboost (or even GradientBoosting) has a clearly better score than HistGradientBoosting https://hal.science/hal-03723551v2/file/Tabular_NeurIPS2022%20(22).pdf#page=28
- end of brownout period for `sklearn` PyPI package \o/, uploaded 0.0.post12 and simplified code
- reviewed/merged a few maintenance PRs deprecation removal for 1.4 + adaptation for latest polars release following lock-file update
- Fixed nightly wheels upload  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27831
- Inria Academy advanced session with Arturo

### Olivier

- Finished teaching Deep Learning for this year :)
- scikit-learn 1.4 milestone reviews:
    - for categorical features / dataframe
    - numpy 2 compat
    - backward compat deprecation clean-up for normalize=True
- MAE / r2_score Array API 
- Retreat project on quantile regression, wrapup notebook:
    - https://nbviewer.org/github/ogrisel/notebooks/blob/master/quantile_regression_as_classification.ipynb
- Weekend hacking studying calibration of Adult Census models to study impact of rich features, sample size and regularization.
- TODO: prepare slides for TC meeting

### Jérémie

- retreat project sklearn analytics.
  interested in consolidating. Google analytics still on ?
- reviews for 1.4
- callbacks
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27663
  todo: set up a drafting meeting for the API to pass a validation set.

### Franck

- Hopefully healed, still tired
- Joblib:
    - [PR](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1526) to fix pipeline instability merged
    - 2 issues to investigate ? [#1529](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1529) bug in locky with windows 11 [#1528](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1528) bug in (cloud?)pickle with type hints
- Working on Array API in sklearn: [27102](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27102) and [27800](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27800), took time to understand some stakes of float64 casting and "unsafe" type promotion rules (int to float) e.g in `_average` function

### Vincent

Probabl
- Draft a structure for the ensembl framework, [see Notion](https://www.notion.so/probabl/Product-boundaries-d124bd33d70f4d159fdb30b8da9fe6f9?pvs=25#14025ba015854daab11155944a10945c)
    local -> cloud or on-premises
- Identify first profile types to recruit w/ Franck, [see Notion](https://www.notion.so/probabl/Product-Engineering-Recruitments-4d6aaee058b14c788c816367f792f5e3?pvs=25)

(please read those drafts and give feedbacks)

Skrub
- Ready to release skrub 0.1!

Survival analysis
- Back on it, more time to dev hazardous and help Julie

### Jérôme

**skrub**

- Joiner PR waiting for final reviews
- reviewing tablevectorizer refactoring pr

**scikit-learn**

- polars categorical features in histogram gradient boosting
- forbid pandas NA in columnvectorizer output

### Guillaume

- Working on end of deprecation code for the release
- Focused on a couple features that we prioritized for the release
    - Polars support in `HistGradientBoosting` (thanks to Jerome)
    - Polars support in `ColumnTransformer` (thanks to Thomas)
- Answering in the forum for the MOOC
- Submitted CZI EOSS proposal
- Teaching on Friday and next Friday
- Weekend hacking: RAG-based LLM following the retreat project

### Arturo

- Inria Chile [Scientific days](https://journeesscientifiques2023.inria.cl/en/program.html)

### TODO:

- TC tomorrow, let's try to be good and be efficient, it's useful for the future of the project
- skrub merge tv + release (?) (Jérôme & Vincent)
- follow-up on polars & pyarrow categories in ColumnTransformer (Jérôme, Guillaume)
- array api in RidgeCV (Jérôme)
- PyData Global (Guillaume, Olivier)
