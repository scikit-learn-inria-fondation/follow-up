    - https://web.stanford.edu/~lutian/coursepdf/unit1.pdf (and PDFs in the parent folder)

### Franck

- Blocking issues being solved in `numba_dpex` following our feedbacks [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/898) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/pull/905) [3](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/pull/896)
- Found minimal reproducer for last blocking issue [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/906)
- `skearn_numba_dpex` plugin progress:
    - overall cleaning PR can merge providing `numba_dpex` fixes last bug [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/88)
    - Added CLI to benchmark script [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/90)

- Scheduled a performance investigation session with Oleksander for KMeans
- Doing a new round of benchmarks on intel edge dev cloud following latest feedbacks from Severine Haubert

### Loïc

- sphinx-gallery Jupyterlite integration ready, waiting for review https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/977
- Need to take feed-back into account for using Plausible https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25547
- jupyterlab-myst 1.0.0 release, longer-term this could simplify some of our setup for the MOOC
- on holidays next Monday for two weeks

### Jérémie

- Online mf with missing values:
  - implement the non online version and reconstruction results are as good as SoftImpute and IterativeSVD, but extremely slow.
  - implemented a l2 version (using ridge instead of lasso to compute the code). No strong impact on the reconstruction quality.
  - Experimented tweaking "scaling the past information" for the online version. Does not seem to have much impact.
  - TODO implement transform for SoftImpute and IterativeSVD to be able to compare on a validation set.
  - found more recent paper combining softimpute and als with better scalability. maybe interesting to try.
- needs review: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25493
  adds an option to global config to disable param validation.

### Vincent

- [Survival] explore [YASGBT](https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/pull/5) parameters and configurations.
  - Read [Tree-based models for survival data with competing risks](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Papers?preview=kretowska2018.pdf)
  - TODO: Add competitive risk.
- [FEA Introduce PairwiseDistances](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25561) yields good performances and introduce CSR distances
- Some Cython reviews: [1](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25575)
- TODO: review [Meekail PR on `ArgKmin.predict_proba()`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24076)

### Gael

- Quelques entretiens annuels:
    - Consolider 
    - Essayer autre chose que numba-dpex? sycl / dpc++ ?
    - Plus structurer des "sous-groupes" dans l'équipe (réunions propres)
- TODO: sprint joblib, will try to dynamically adapt to load
