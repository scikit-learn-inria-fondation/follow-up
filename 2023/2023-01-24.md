### Loïc

- Pyodide: 
  + session with Roman mostly on using OpenBLAS https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3331
  + some generic clean-up/improvements/errors investigation + summary of errors in
    https://github.com/lesteve/scipy-tests-pyodide and
    https://github.com/lesteve/scikit-learn-tests-pyodide
  + sphinx-gallery Jupyterlite integration
    https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/977
- scikit-learn
  + back to simpler CircleCI-only doc build: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25466. Thomas will probably look at it.
  + Second opinion on disabling sklearn wheel caching: https://github.com/scikit-learn/sklearn-pypi-package/pull/4
  + nogil lock file update saga
    + made Cython 0.29.33 available for nogil: https://github.com/colesbury/nogil-wheels/pull/3
    + updating nogil lock file https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25437 originally broke some of our tests
    + debugged + reported https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/issues/102
    + turns out it is a thread-safety issue in numpy NEP 50 (promotion rules for Python scalars) implementation https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/23057 
- Loky PR https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/255 fixing exception `__cause__` propagation
  with tblib. Original issue opened in joblib https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1369 in a xarray/Dask context

### Guillaume

- Blocking point:
     - Being more lenient regarding expect type in a common test: [#25467](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25467)
     - Validation set split in `HistGradientBoosting` [#25460](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25460)
     - Implementation of ZCA whitening in `FastICA` [#25458](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25458)
- Would need second reviews on [#25392](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25392) [#21809](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21809)
- Some business model reflection
- Give an hand for the release 1.2.1
- Look at the example of Jeremie

### Jérémie

- Still working on an example for online dictionary learning with missing values with the help of Guillaume
  - not clear which metrics to chose
  - when there are a lot of missing values, we need more components
- helping julien with the release
- off next week (ski \o/)

### François

- Meeting Business Model with Vincent and Guillaume
- Meeting with Yann Lechelle about P16/skits
- Meeting with Gaël and Marc Richard (candidate) about job ad:
    - https://jobs.inria.fr/public/classic/en/offres/2022-05590
- Worked on the consortium website
    - feel free to write suggestions about nice to have features: https://notes.inria.fr/K6dxXPWTQZWm_OX0d1ajQg#
- Meetings with Jean-Michel about the oral presentation of skits/P16 in front of the independant committee/jury. 
- Communication: worked on a shorter template for bugfix release videos.

### Olivier

- cloudpickle maintenance with a bugfix release
- 1.2.1 release assist
- review sklearn_numba_dpex sum reduction
- design review/discussions on engine API
- various follow-ups on old PRs
    - CI upgrades to use Cirrus CI
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25186 (isolation forest 8x speed-up)
- started to test and give benchmarks to newton-lsmr solver PR:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25462

### Franck

- Ran benchmarks on Flex170 on intel edge dev cloud
	+ Nice speedup [1](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/75#issuecomment-1385691164) ...
	+ ...not without a few issues and fixes [1](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/85) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1036)
- Merged sum kernel on axis 0 [1](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/80) [2](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/87) [3](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/86) 
- [TopK PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/81) waiting for @ogrisel approval
- Many minor leftover tasks for possible performance improvement accross the repo:
	+ using 2D grid of work items
	+ testing different sub-group-sizes (higher is better ?)
	+ understanding compiler optimization in some cases (e.g regarding conditions in loops)
	+ open "good first issue" issues for each ?
- [Issue](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/issues/588) with `intel-compute-runtime` packaging in ubuntu got turned away, surprisingly
    - will insist with intel customer priority support
    - will contact ubuntu maintainers directly
- Provided testing and feedback for latest `numba_dpex` development and bugfixes [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/886) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/868) [3](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/865) [4](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/816) [5](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/867)
- Progress on KNN:
	+ strategy: sequentially: compute distances in a buffer, then reduce, and repeat
	+ pairwise distance == matmul. Currently implementing a matmul (NB: no `gemm` available in `numba_dpex`, although it's used in `cupy`). What about matmul in `dpnp` ?
	+ hesitating on level of optimization of the buffer use for the first milestone.
- Meeting with Intel ML team.
	+ possible collaboration on benchmarking `sklearn-numba-dpex` on max series
	+ expected follow-up with a list of packaging issues
- Reviewing [Tim work](https://github.com/ogrisel/scikit-learn/pull/13): good progress on the implementation of the plugin api 


### Vincent

- Tentative to optimize the core routine of `SparseSparseMiddleTermComputer` based on Scipy's `csr_matmat` but I failed, since we use chunk while Scipy's use full matrices. Instead, I removed some TODOs. [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25449).
- Business plan discussion w/ Guillaume & François
- Review Tree criterion [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24678) of Adam w/ Julien —and discovery of our tree codebase on my part.
- Some Cython review, weird CI bugs on this [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25415?notification_referrer_id=NT_kwDOARs1grM1MzQ3OTE5NDY3OjE4NTYwMzg2&notifications_query=reason%3Amention).


### Julien
