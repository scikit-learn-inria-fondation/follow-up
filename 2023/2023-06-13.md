### Gael

- Moving skrub forward (we now have the skeletton of the website use sphinx pydata theme)
- Meeting with P. Valduriez on DB and Data integration
- Brainstorming about
    - Nested parallelism in ColumnTransformer
    - Very fast and quite dirty nearest-neighbor match for strings
- TODO: prepare sprint (aka decide what to do, create corresponding issues / discussion)

### François

Consortium
- Sprint logistic
- Partially solved the consortium budget issue, meetings with Fondation Inria, InriaSoft, Inria Saclay, STIP Saclay.
- Moving forward with CapGemini, NVIDIA, Chanel (Fondation Inria needs to approve)
- Started discussions and thinking about the consortium future

Probabl
- Side discussions, internal lobbying
- Working on getting YL paid
- Meeting with Camille T. 

### Olivier

- off 1.5 days
- MOOC sprint: follow-up meeting to review quiz questions with worst scores + feedback from the forum to make a decision for each of them
- design discussions for the validation curve plotting function to include in scikit-learn 1.3
- hazardous: mini-sprint: started to extract/refactor the truck failure synthetic dataset to make it part of `hazardous.data` (still WIP, no PR yet)
- working on a very late JMLR review


### Jérémie

- Preparing the release
  - discussions/review ValidationCurveDisplay (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25120). Needs 1 more +1
  - reviewed missing values in RF https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26391. Pretty simple and could easily be in 1.3
  - needs review on release highlights https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26526
  - clean up what's new https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26567
  - fix in scipy-dev https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26566. 1 more failure left after that.
  - these 2 still need review https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26495 and https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26473. Skip nested param validation in estimators and functions
- off next Friday (20th anniversary \o/)

### Arturo

    - [Gladia](https://www.gladia.io/)
    - search engine project from Paris Digital Lab de CentraleSupélec (still beta)
- MOOC
    - discuss [notes on worst quiz results](https://notes.inria.fr/_cdXjV3_TtGcfjipTi0Zfw#)
    - RidgeCV notebook [#698](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/698)
    - add labels to plot in Quiz M1.2 Q4 [#699](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/699)
    - forum feedback MR [!73](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/73)
- Added entry to my [notes on useless examples](https://notes.inria.fr/nhZPcMlCQyWv-xBFkiKUcA#) (to use during the sprint?)

### Franck

- Back from two weeks long off time
- Access to intel edge dev cloud was finally [fixed](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-DevCloud/The-data-associated-with-your-account-seems-to-be-invalid/m-p/1494845/emcs_t/S2h8ZW1haWx8dG9waWNfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufExJU01MQ1lMWEZIR0M5fDE0OTQ4NDV8U1VCU0NSSVBUSU9OU3xoSw#M8272) !!!
- Got back access to drago/margaret servers (following SSH keys loss)
- KNN: got 2x speedup on GPU using PyTorch on Flex. Also small speedup on iGPU.
- Implemented KMeans with PyTorch using `scatter_add_`
    - disappointing results
    - bottleneck relies in `scatter_add_`, that can be optimized
    - will compare to cuda `scatter_add_`
    - might get viable performance if `scatter_add_` bottleneck is optimized !!!
- Reported `dpctl` issues with implementation of `__dlpack__` interface [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1240) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/dpctl/issues/1241)
- feature request for pytorch: `cdist` without sqrt applied ?
- any news from euroscipy ?
- only two days and already a lot of grind for environment setup...
- TODO: 
    - test KNN and k-means (and `scatter-add`) on `cuda`
    - reach back to Jay for intel management meeting
    - first twitch stream ?

### Vincent

- Many reviews and PR for skrub & hazardous

### Yann

- meeting Camille T. with Vincent & François
- interesting call with Lynn C.
- delivered Probabl timeline to Inria's management
- final foundation captable adjustments
- contract discussion with Inria
- board meeting with HUB France IA (redefining the mission)

### TODO

- MOOC related PRs (Arturo)
- Advance product discovery (François, Yann, Vincent)
- Organize 2nd meeting with Camille T (Yann)
- Prepare min Probabl presentation for sprint @ Dataiku (Yann)
- Start preparing bylaws / shareholder agreements / comms (Yann)
- Prepare a pad for sprint issues/topics (François)
- Reviews for 1.3 milestone and Release 1.3 (Jérémie, Olivier)
