## October 3rd, 2023

### Gael

- Dossier déonto
- Postioning: we need the red hat of scikit-learn

### Arturo

- scikit-learn
    - some reviews / merges;
    - iter on hgbt regression example [#26991](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26991);
- MOOC
    - expand quizzes related to new contents [!79](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/79);
    - iter on the introduction of `predict_proba` [#723](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/723);
    - rework non-linear regression notebook [#724](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/724);
    - wording on linear regression intro [#725](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/725);
- Inria Chile

### Olivier

- Working on PCA-related PRs:
    - Array API bug reported by Franck:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27431
    - Reviewing PCA on sparse input with implicit centering:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18689
    - New covariance + eigh solver for `n_samples >> n_features`:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27491
        - works really well for low `n_features` values
        - works with Array API (e.g. Pytorch CUDA, MPS and cpu, CuPy...)
        - as fast as cuML's PCA on NVIDIA GPUs
        - found a way to adapt the "auto" heuristic quite robustly
        - still need to compare against scikit-learn-intelex on CPU
        - would benefit from being integrated in Franck's benchmark tool
- Updated my retour de mission for EuroScipy \o/
- TODO:
    - MOOC (see last's week TODOs) and review Arturo's latest PRs
    - Review Christian's PR on stopping criterion fixes for logistic regression

### Franck

- Back from 1 week off. 
- Finished set up a clean benchmark repository built on top of benchopt, see [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/pull/1)
    - It implements an automated workflow to maintain a google spreadsheet of all results (accross implementation, devices, different parameters,...), which is released [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1te_3jY6vI4wo3-V7xbmWQai5Mdh5plWdLst2ox0wuLM)
- Currently re-running all benchmarks in all environments with most up to date/favorable setups, starting with `sklearn_numba_dpex` backend
    - many issues with latest bumps of dependencies, reported on [numba_dpex tracker](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/1152) (best effort report ~ lot of failing tests but very hard to find minimal reproducers)
    - currently bisecting our build script to find what particular parameter or combination of parameters give wrong builds. Current hypothesis: only `numba_dpex` is faulty, all other dependencies can be bumped carelessly.
- Also currently giving a new try at building intel xpu extension for triton.

### Jérémie

- threadpoolctl: fix for lib name collisions
  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/151
- sklearn + cython + benchs
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27521
  (don't know what to do with `safe_realloc`)
- profile with perf but didn't see anything in particular except most of the time stuck in locks which confirms that it has to do with the acquired when it shouldn't be.
- checked with latest cython master but weird results: need to do it again

### Jérôme

counting meeting
- Pyladies meetup

Probabl:
- Quantstack/Jupyter project collaboration
- Onyxia collaboration
- Product vision discussions
- Internal Q&A communication
- Testing operational and IT tools 

### Guillaume:

- Upload the wheel for Python 3.12 after merging Loic PRs
- Proposal for PyData Global
- Some reviews for sparse container adaptation in the tests
- Refactoring `TableVectorizer` halfway
- PRs needing review:
    - (Needed for `TunedThresholdClassifier`) add `response_method` in `make_scorer`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26840
    - (Compat arrays/matrices) downcasting indices: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27372
    - (Deprecation pandas-dev) downcasting object columns: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27482
    - Displays improvements by adding `class_of_interest` in DecisionBoundaryDisplay: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/27291
