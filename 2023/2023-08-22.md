    - maybe continue work on hazardous
    - retour de mission

### Arturo

    - mentoring StefanieSegner [#26805](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26805), [#26877](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26877);
    - talk on recommendation system went smooth: implement `min_df` or `stop_words`?
- iter on recommender system [#1125](https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1125)

### Franck

- EuroSciPy:
    - talk "Bringing GPU-powered backends to scikit-learn" [summary](https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/UVBBQZ/)
        - went well apparently
        - need small updates on slides before updating (metadata on benchmark + run on better devices)
    - maintainer's track Interoperability in the Scientific Python Ecosystem [summary](https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/YBQTGU/)
        - lots of maintainers going in basically the same direction, let's continue
    - sprint scikit-learn: some people contributing to array-api / testing torch backend with exotic devices (apple m2)
- Next Monday: meeting with Vladimir Kostarev from Intel for discussion promotion of work on kmeans ?
- `sklearn_numba_dpex` green again, but latest updates introduced a new significant bug with `numba_dpex` [issue](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/1106)
    - including funny drama at [rebase PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26949) ...
- Small contribution to discussion on missing values support in kbindiscretizer [#26794](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26794)
    - any interest in also singling-out implicit values in sparse inputs ? (see [QuantileTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.QuantileTransformer.html))
- Excellent performance from Raft BfKNN difficult to analyze. Need help to get started ?
- Opened repository [`sklearn_pytorch_engine`](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-pytorch-engine)
    - started working on k-means in pytorch
- A bit of help in summarizing issues with a minor dependency issue in skrub [issue](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/issues/698)
- Mistakenly skipped intel meeting. Good feedback given by Jay on usage of kernels.
- joblib:
    - Reviewed [#698](https://github.com/skrub-data/skrub/issues/698): improve behavior if input iterator raises an exception
    - CI bumps in merge waiting room [#1487](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1487)
    - `generator_unordered` in merge waiting room ? [#1463](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1463)
    - discussion about Parallel dependency to Logging [issue](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1483)

### Vincent

EuroScipy
- Nice talks, I need to re-contact people for survival analysis use-cases (e.g. Denis from Roche, Joost from ING Bank).
- Some interest for skrub as well (2 people from Deutsche Telekom already using skrub and eager to contribute)

Skrub
- Lot of fixes on the doc
- Some fixes on the CI
- Need to talk about Ibis in Skrub. 
    - Which dataframes do we want to support?
    - What to do when users have large polars DataFrames and want to execute functions using sklearn NearestNeighbor? 

Books
- I had fun reading how [ConvNext](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545) (a recent ConvNet) can actually beat vision transformers (Swan-T) when adopting similar architecture and training choices (without attention layers).
    - The important take is that [depthwise separable convolution](https://vincent-maladiere.github.io/14-4-other-forms-of-convolution.html) is somewhat comparable to multi-head self attention.
