- started [notes on useless examples](https://notes.inria.fr/nhZPcMlCQyWv-xBFkiKUcA#)

### Jérémie

- Preparing 1.3
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26434
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26424
  - drop 3.8 or not ? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26438
  - several PRs in the milestone looks good and already have 2 reviewers but are not merged yet. I commented there and will merge in a couple of days.
- TODO before 1.3: follow-up of nested param validation PR: apply it to all estimators. I haven't found a clean way to only validate at the first call to partial_fit yet...

### François

P16
- Wimmics Team @Sophia: presentation of Correse. Good discussions about knowledge graphs, semantic web. 
- AXA @Köln: Lots of discussions about P16, potential investor + good contacts about MLOps topics for product discovery

Consortium
- Sprint: Working with Fondation Inria to be able to use the budget...
- Chanel: Worked on the sponsorship contract with Fondation Inria
- AXA: Participation to the AXA Dev Summit, preparation of a talk (scikit-learn and beyond with Vincent). Check the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W-n_X6G92CkZ0d6cGcFOjvisMQoLIPLb/view?usp=sharing). 
- scikit-llm: presentation of Iryna Kondrachenko? More generally could be nice to have a stage for related projects. 
- BCG: Managed to have a meeting next Friday
