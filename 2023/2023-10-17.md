### Gael

- Not much: some contacts with Intel and other actors
- Making sure that the contract of Jeremie goes smoothly

### Franck

- Working on benchmarks at [sklearn-engine-benchmarks](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/) project:
    - Merged/published the k-means benchmark [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/pull/2)
    - Wrote and ran most of the benchmarks for PCA [PR](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-engine-benchmarks/pull/2)
    - check out the awesome [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1te_3jY6vI4wo3-V7xbmWQai5Mdh5plWdLst2ox0wuLM) of results! it is automatically synchronized with the benchmark data commited to the repo! Now with colors!
    - Next: finish PCA, run benchmarks on local hardware, do other benchmarks,...
- Failed and reported [issue](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/441) when compiling latest commit of intel extension for pytorch 
- TODO: investigate kmeans++ regression at sklearn-numba-dpex (underwhelming performance seen in benchmarks).

### Arturo

- scikit-learn
    - wrote report on recommender system [#26180](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26180#issuecomment-1765940782) -> should be good to go on sphinx-gallery once I fix the conflics :sweat_smile:;
    - review stuff (took over [#26623](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26623));
- MOOC
    - [Open Education Night](https://www.edflex.com/blog/open-education-night);
    - remove classification problem from Wrap-up quiz M4 [!80](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/80);
    - make exercise out of classification problem from Wrap-up quiz M4 (no PR yet, needs [#710](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/710));

- a bit of MOOC live reviews with Arturo
- a bit of PCA / array api / cuml benchmark live reviews with Franck
- had a call with Quantstack to discuss planned jupyterlite improvements that could be useful for scikit-learn and the MOOC
- Investigated a seemingly Python 3.12 related problem in threadpoolctl:
    - https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/155
    - is actually related to gentoo packagingYeah, I suppose any library in the stack could incidentally bring OpenMP in.

    - openmp can be Yeah, I suppose any library in the stack could incidentally bring OpenMP in.
linked to the system Python via the BLAKE2 hash function implementation
- Reviewed Array API `r2_score`:
