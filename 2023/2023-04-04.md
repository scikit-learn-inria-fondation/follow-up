### Arturo

- Iter on recommender system to sphinx-gallery [#1081](https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/issues/1081) (with Guillaume)
- iter on outlier detection example [#25878](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25878) (with Olivier)
- matplotlib `DeprecationWarning` PR [#26017](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26017) (update min-dependencies or use workaround?)
- mooc-based course at Ecole Nationale des Chartes
- discussion with Julien MAUPETIT from FUN


### Loïc

- Pyodide
  + significant progress for using OpenBLAS https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3331. CI is green which does not mean that much. Running the full scipy tests locally and trying to understand regressions, right now a determinant of a complex matrix is always 0 :-( ... On the other hand it has fixed some known issues (e.g. missing symbols in CLAPACK)
  + a class of errors seems to have disappeared by itself https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/3203
- sphinx-gallery
  + adding cells based on the notebook content merged: https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1113
  + some cleanup PRs after adding the JupyterLite functionality e.g. https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery/pull/1123
- scikit-learn
  + some feed-back from Adrin and Thomas on JupyterLite PR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25887. This seems almost mergable although it will need a sphinx-gallery release to have the functionality to add cells + fixes. CORS issues with OpenML breaking fetch_openml, I commented here to ask OpenML to add the necessary response headers https://github.com/openml/OpenML/issues/1135#issuecomment-1494892890
  + Plausible PR merged getting stats on the dev doc https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25547
  + a bit of maintenance reviews (display auto-API template, coverage on docker job)
- fixed the dirty_cat gallery https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat/pull/538 

### François

- Sync and preparation of Monday's evaluation for P16
- Preparing next steps / April's schedule
- Off tonight until Tuesday

### Jérémie

- Cython lint ready: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25861
  (I'm now a core dev of cython-lint :) )
- (A lot of) reviews for param validation PRs
- Skip nested param validation https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25815
  I just realized that sometimes (very rarely) we don't want to skip nested
  (call with guillaume after meeting)
- reviewed Guillaume's PRs for get_response
- Back to matrix factorization with missing values. Implemented a predictive version of IterativeSVD. TODO: run some experiments (e.g. vs IterativeImputer).

### Vincent

- [Survival] Polished the dataset generator [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/blob/add_factory_dataset/notebooks/factory_dataset.ipynb)
- [Survival] Began notebook Part 1 for JupyterCon
- Read both papers for dirty-cat (SimilarityEncoder,  MinHashEncoder & GapEncoder)
- Further talks with APHP plateform team to replace spark by polars
- Was almost off: ill yesterday and recovered a bit today


### Olivier

- SLEP 6 design discussions, needs to get back to it
- Finally fixed coverage, including for 32 bit Python, useful for:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23731
- More experiments with Arturo on outliers dataset for the benchmarks:
    - better dataset selection on the way
    - we should investigate with nmslib transformer for approximate nearest neighbors to make LOF scalable.
- Remote pair programming on Intel GPUs to try to understand why `sklearn_numba_dpex`'s KMeans implementation does not work well.
- Off yesterday + teaching on Monday and Friday this week
- cpu_count with `only_physical_cores=True` by default for OpenMP:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26082
- TODO:
    - review, review, review
    - come back to linear regression solvers tests
    - SLEP 6
    - Work on jupytercon tutorial

### Guillaume

- SciPy PR to fix `astype` on read-only sparse matrix
- Presentation of scikit-learn + fondation at Brussels
- Stuff going forward around refactoring of `_get_response_values`
- Pair programming with Arturo
- Review on parameter validation
- Sprint Zurich
- Helping Adrin and Maren with reviewing application for internship

### Franck

- Merged [`matmul` kernel](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/102), performances remain underwhelming, but acceptable to continue forward with `KNN`
    - opened [discussions](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/984) on `numba_dpex`, hoping to get someone else onboard for this project
- Updated [TopK kernel](https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/81) to more recent standards in `sklearn_numba_dpex`, performances look similar to `matmul` but having issues with caching (again) in `numba_dpex` to complete benchmark
- Remote pair-programming with Sasha: reproducing and running diagnostics for performance issues for `KMeans` on PVC GPUsh
- Got a short but interesting access to PVC on intel beta cloud offer
- Signaled interest to [`Triton` + `SYCL`developers](https://github.com/openai/triton/pull/1299), ~~happiness~~ up to standard SYCL support is expected for Q2 2023
