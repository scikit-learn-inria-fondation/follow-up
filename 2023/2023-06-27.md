### Olivier

- sklearn sprint
- Investigated segfault when running scikit-learn tests on x86_64 macos/windows with scipy 1.11.0:
    - https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/18751
- Array API support for PCA draft PR is almost ready for review:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26315
- Fighting with sphinx to unblock the joblib release: no error message, return code 0 but the doc is not generated (and readthedocs is rightfully red):
    - https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1457
- Ongoing review of the `newton-lsmr` solver:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25462
    - found limit cases to make it break or fallback to LBFGS
    - benchopt session found a bug in `newton-cholesky` (fixed)
    - still need a complete review and measure impact on memory usage on large problems
- TODO: make the joblib release happen
- TODO: review release highlights if not too late
- TODO: follow-up on sprint PRs
- TODO: follow-up on mooc PRs
- TODO: euroscipy trip organization

    - also an invitation to a maintainer track discussing scikit-learn backends
- XPU backend for triton [released](https://github.com/intel/intel-xpu-backend-for-triton/) (alpha-version)
    - currently trying to build it + pytorch 2.0.1 + IPEX ...
- Work on joblib:
    - last changes to the generator API before release [https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1458]

    - CoE meeting on 5th July


### Vincent

[sprint scikit-learn]
- [PR Introduce PairwiseDistances #25561](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25561) has lower performances than expected on CSR x CSR and Dense x CSR for Manhattan distance (almost 100% longer). Need to profile it to go further.
