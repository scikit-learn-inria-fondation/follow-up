### Guillaume

- Parameter validation: issue 1 vs 1.0 [#25481](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25481)
- Maintenance:
    - `fetch_openml`
    - `config_context` side-effect `IsotonicRegression`
- Meeting Quantmetry on MAPIE
- Will be off from Friday for some time (at least until the 14th February)

### Julien

 - Release 1.2.1 (identified missing instructions)
 - [MAINT Replace `cnp.ndarray`s with typed memoryviews](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/25484) to better support some workflow with joblib
 - Sync with Vincent for Trees (understanding the implementation) + `PairwiseDistances`
 - Discussion with Adams (regarding a refactoring that we prioritize after support for missing values and support for categorical variables)
 - [Documentation rework](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25457) for release processes: I am hesitating about the kind of rework to perform. To me there is high cognitive load when reading the documentation on this aspect, and I think we should probably have a page per process.
     - Two PRs: one for information another for restructuration

### François

- Turing Offices
    - Test the stand-up desks if you are ok to order one for you, list your name above if interested: 
    - Moving when they installed the desks + claustra
    - Want stand-up desk:
        - Olivier
        - Franck
        - François
        - Guillaume
- Skits
    - Recruiting P16 lead
        - Meetings with Gaël and Yann, with Yann.
        - Meetings with Jean-Michel, François Cuny to try to move forward
    - EDF Lab, 2nd visit
    - Meeting with MAPIE (Quantmetry), discussion about conformal predictions. Relevant team on confidence intervals. Potential for collaboration through Skits in the framework of the Confiance.ai collaboration or outsourcing.
    - Working on the slides for the jury + getting in touch with the new Coordinateur National IA
    - Meeting with Vincent, Guillaume and data scientists to discuss about our value proposition  
- Consortium
    - Fujitsu is leaving the consortium
        > The main reason is in our end, not yours. As you may know, Fujitsu is collaborating with Data Shape team (Fred) in Inria, and one of the motivations why Fujitsu joined is to contribute Scikit-learn from time series data analysis viewpoint by using TDA.  It looks too early or insufficient yet, Fujitsu could not contribute much from the perspective. As the result, I couldn't make our management members convince. In parallel, we have transferred the tech from lab to business unit now, and there is not much reason to continue neither. This is another reason.
    - The website is almost ready

### Vincent

- [Survival analysis] implemented Olivier's model: a HistGBT model approximating the Brier score. Performances are competitive on the KKBox dataset: [Yet Another Survival Gradient Boosting Tree (YASGBT)](https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/pull/2/files#diff-4aca1b29f051991996a59feb830745f3d7946300e389b954f0312d329cd50f2e).
- Took the time to deep dive on our decision tree implementation w/ Julien.
- Good talk about Data Science usage with *the company B* w/ Guillaume & François.
- Reviewed some small Cython PRs: [1](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25507), [2](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25510#issuecomment-1410876007), [3](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25415#issuecomment-1411680905)
- TODO: Tackling [FEA Introduce PairwiseDistances](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/23958) w/ Julien

### Olivier

    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25480
- Design review of:
    - https://github.com/soda-inria/survival-analysis-benchmark/pull/2
    - New strategy to minimize Integrated Brier Score with monotonic cst `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.
    - Reflecting on the need of a Brier loss with a softmax inverse link function:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/23525
- Reviewing the update of `sklearn_numba_dpex` to the new `wip-engines` API
    - https://github.com/soda-inria/sklearn-numba-dpex/pull/74
- Started to review the `TargetEncoder` PR starting with the example:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25334

### Franck

- Major issues found in `numba_dpex` [1](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/892) [2](https://github.com/IntelPython/numba-dpex/issues/891)
    - helping with reproducers, analysis, and feedback on performance and UX
    - live debug session schedule with maintainer on Friday
    - this is blocking for progress, considering pausing until is fixed. Alternative todos:
        - joblib
        - small leftover tasks
        - working on the plugin API on the sklearn side
        - if not fixed, try to repair `numba_dpex` or consider `C++` implementations
- /!\ unit tests broken on `wip-engines`
- Communications with Severine at Intel ML Team
  - ran our benchmark, it shows bad performances
  - feedback on packaging
- Work on joblib [#588 _(return_generator)_](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/588) with Thomas Moreau
    - multiprocessing backend is unstable, is it ok to:
        - disable return_generator for backend multiprocessing ?
        - or: enable, but warns of unstability
    - verbose progress printing is broken when `n_jobs=1` with `SequentialBackend`
    - One remaining test for fork bomb mitigation is unstable on some platforms
- Will be off on Thursday 02/02

### TODO

- `sklearn_numba_dpex` and `wip-engines` (Olivier)
- Review `TargetEncoder` (Olivier)
- Inria Academy three next Thursdays (February 2, 9, 16) (Loïc, Arturo)
- Recruiting PM (Francois, Gael)
- Renewal COE Intel/Inria (Olivier)
- Slides jury French National Strategy (François)
- communication NVIDIA-consortium (François)
- Address remaining issues in [#588 _(return_generator)_](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/588) (Franck w/ Thomas Moreau)
