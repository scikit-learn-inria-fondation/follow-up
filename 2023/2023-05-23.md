### Gaël

- Migrated the skrub website (http://skrub-data.org/stable/, still WIP)

### Olivier

- Read a bit about calibration error measures after Preetum Nakkiran's team presentation last week
- Discussed strategy for k-NN on GPU with Franck (try to use PyTorch and Array API)
- Review / design discussions on Array API related things
    - Common tests and dedicated estimator tag:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26372
    - Discussing inclusion of LU factorization in the Array API spec:
        - https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/627
        - LU factorization would be useful for randomized PCA:
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26315
    - Discussing inclusion of argpartition and/or topk in the Array API spec
        - https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/629
        - This would be useful to implement exact/bruteforce k-NN on GPUs via PyTorch
    - Discussing support for NaN reductions (`nanmax` and co):
        - https://github.com/data-apis/array-api/issues/621
        - This would be useful for MinMaxScaler (and others):
            - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26243
- Review pass on sparse SplineTransformer:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/24145
- WIP/TODO: reviewing Arturo's PR, in particular on speed accuracy trade-off of RF vs HGBDT
- TODO: review PRs mentionned at the team meeting:
    - SLEP 6
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26329 (XSIMD for custom DistanceMetric implementations, outside of scikit-learn)
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26411 (categorical values in HGBDT without the need for a pipeline / columntransformer + cat feature info propagation)
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26391 (missing values in RF)
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25815 (nested param validation)

### Loïc

- scikit-learn:
  - Pyodide wheel build in CI https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26374
  - some maintenance PR related to nogil failure
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26388
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26389
  - helping scipy-dev build to be less red by merging
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26386
  - conda-lock improvements with conda/pip mixed dependencies
    https://github.com/conda/conda-lock/pull/290, hoping for a conda-lock release
    in the not too far future ...
- Pyodide
  - scikit-image use JupyterLite button
    https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/6911, also mentioned at
    Scientific Python developer summit (Community & Documentation)
    https://hackmd.io/YL5DNtsaSsS-1ZU3Pxkrxg#Tutorial-Infrastructure
  - meson for scikit-image in Pyodide https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3874
  - progress on error with scipy inside Pyodide venv
    https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/3865
- starting Grenoble position next week, bar tomorrow

### Arturo

- slides for FUN conference
- restarted working on HGBDT vs RF example [#26320](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26320)
- TODO: investigate fail in Isolation Forest PR [#25878](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25878)

### Jérémie

- Fixed asv benchmarks.
  - Switched to conda-forge => cut
                            => openblas => slowdown for some estimators
  - thought there was a huge regression for minibatch kmeans, looked for the guilty commit. Turns out there was no regression, probably an issue with last night run... "Avant de nous inquiéter de la cause, assurons nous bien du fait."
- reviews for 1.3. 
  - Twitter workflow broken https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26419
- needs review for 1.3
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/26016
  - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/25815

### Guillaume

- In vacation
- Reviewing SLEP006 (in progress)

### Franck

- Will be off for two weeks starting May 29th
- Draft testimonial using `numba_dpex` for k-means at https://hackmd.io/3QJ6aOtvTOGLPb-_FO0h-g?view
- Experimented with twitch streaming setup
- Preparing slides for CoE review meeting
